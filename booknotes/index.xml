      <title>The Psychology of Money</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/pom.jpg&#34; width=&#34;150px&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/book-the-psychology-of-money/&#34;&gt;The Psychology of Money&lt;/a&gt;, by Morgan Housel, is probably the first book I would read. More than short term tactics, it deals with the mindset we need to develop to acquire wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have included the most relevant quotes from the book below, although I highly recommend that you read the whole book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Two topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them or not: health and money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Physics isn’t controversial. It’s guided by laws. Finance is different. It’s guided by people’s behaviors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely recreate the power of fear and uncertainty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every decision people make with money is justified by taking the information they have at the moment and plugging it into their unique mental model of how the world works.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The lowest-income households in the U.S. on average spend $412 a year on lotto tickets, four times the amount of those in the highest income groups. Forty percent of Americans cannot come up with $400 in an emergency. Which is to say: Those buying $400 in lottery tickets are by and large the same people who say they couldn’t come up with $400 in an emergency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bill Gates experienced one in a million luck by ending up at Lakeside. Kent Evans experienced one in a million risk by never getting to finish what he and Gates set out to achieve.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Someone else’s failure is usually attributed to bad decisions, while your own failures are usually chalked up to the dark side of risk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The difficulty in identifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the best way to manage money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Studying a specific person can be dangerous because we tend to study extreme examples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The more extreme the outcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons to your own life, because the more likely the outcome was influenced by extreme ends of luck or risk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won’t wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—will push you to the point of regret.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Buffett’s fortune isn’t due to just being a good investor, but being a good investor &lt;strong&gt;since he was literally a child&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Linear thinking is so much more intuitive than exponential thinking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Getting money and keeping money are two different skills.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Compounding only works if you can give an asset years and years to grow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Merely good returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone’s reality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in between is filled with misery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need short-term paranoia to keep you alive long enough to exploit long-term optimism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The great art dealers operated like index funds. They bought everything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, not individual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An investor can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anything that is huge, profitable, famous, or influential is the result of a tail event—an outlying one-in-thousands or millions event.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A few companies account for most of the market’s return [Note:Buy diversified index funds]&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Warren Buffett said he’s owned 400 to 500 stocks during his life and made most of his money on 10 of them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Doing something you love on a schedule you can’t control can feel the same as doing something you hate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;we’ve used our greater wealth to buy bigger and better stuff. But we’ve simultaneously given up more control over our time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If respect and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it. Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wealth is what you don’t see.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is so ingrained in us that to have money is to spend money that we don’t get to see the restraint it takes to actually be wealthy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Writing Well</title>
      <link>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/writingwell/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/writingwell/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/oww.jpg&#34; width=&#34;150px&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing often on this site lately, so I decided to listen to the audio version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060891541&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;William Zinsser&lt;/strong&gt;. The book was highly recommended by &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org&#34;&gt;Derek Sivers&lt;/a&gt;. More than a collection of grammatical rules and techniques, &lt;em&gt;On Writing Well&lt;/em&gt; is a common sense guide on how to keep your writing concise and engaging. Here are the passages and concepts that resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-art-or-craft&#34;&gt;Writing: Art or Craft?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing is a craft, like carpentry or plumbing. As any craft, it has its tools. The tools of writing are words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-Writing&lt;/strong&gt; is more important than writing. Writing never comes out right the first time around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-principles-of-good-writing&#34;&gt;The Principles of Good Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brevity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humanity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-clarity&#34;&gt;1. Clarity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarity is the goal in writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reader must understand &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read your sentences aloud to see if they are clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-simplicity&#34;&gt;2. Simplicity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove clutter from your writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rid your writing of any &lt;strong&gt;pretentiousness&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pomposity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;fat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use simple words: don&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;assistance&amp;rdquo; when you can say &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m congnizant of&amp;rdquo; when you can say &amp;ldquo;I know&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing is hard: &lt;mark&gt;easy writing makes hard reading&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-brevity&#34;&gt;3. Brevity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short is better than long&lt;/strong&gt;: short sentences are better than long sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut your writing by 50%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things you can cut:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adverbs (loudly, thoroughly, etc.). Most of the time, the verb is enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most adjectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualifiers: &amp;ldquo;sort of&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;a little bit&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anouncing what you&amp;rsquo;re about to say: &amp;ldquo;As you probably may have noticed&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-humanity&#34;&gt;4. Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write the way you talk&lt;/strong&gt;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t speak a certain way, don&amp;rsquo;t write it that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sound like a person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are writing for YOU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert about a subject. You just need to be interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your style is your personality in writing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to be ornate or pretentious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attitude&#34;&gt;Attitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All writers are driven by ego.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-esteem is important: write about what YOU want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to write compelling stories, you need self-esteem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are you writing for? You!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your writing is the gift of &lt;strong&gt;who you are&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discipline&#34;&gt;Discipline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many times you won&amp;rsquo;t feel like writing, so you need &lt;strong&gt;strong discipline&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;work habits&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reader has to believe that the writer is feeling good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You learn to write by writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no right or wrong way to write: some write a full text and then review. Others write one paragraph and re-writes it often before moving to the next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no right or wrong time to write but you need to &lt;strong&gt;establish a routine&lt;/strong&gt; for writing and stick to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-writing will give you pleasure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-tips&#34;&gt;How-To Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing is &lt;strong&gt;visual&lt;/strong&gt;. Good writing catches the eye before it catches the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;plain&lt;/strong&gt; words that you can relate to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;active&lt;/strong&gt; verbs: active verbs give momentum to a sentence and helps you picture &lt;strong&gt;who did what&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-syllable active verbs are the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate passive verbs: they remove the person from the sentence, and force you to come up with a passive noun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;short&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; nouns that we all know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad nouns are usually of latin origin: &lt;strong&gt;orientation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;implementation&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. (too long and sound pretentious).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are not an expert on a subject just show &lt;strong&gt;sincerity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To write good English you have to read good English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find role-models and imitate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write with your &amp;ldquo;ear&amp;rdquo;: &lt;strong&gt;rhythm&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;cadence&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;musicality&lt;/strong&gt; are very important. Read your sentences aloud to see if they sound write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a sentence doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;sound&amp;rdquo; right, re-write it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that your sentences are well connected, otherwise you will lose your reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;information-and-narrative&#34;&gt;Information and Narrative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is nothing more interesting (and effective) than the truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to explain what is already clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sincerity is your most important credential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narratives: everybody loves stories. Tell a story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make ample use of quotes. Quotes are the best way to convey what people think, say or feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quotes make your writing credible and interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the skill of interviewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interview with pen and paper, not a recording device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate quotes with your writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good interviewer has to generate &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be true to yourself!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAW&lt;/strong&gt; (prodigious accumulator of wealth) is someone who has achieved high &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp&#34;&gt;net worth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;UAW&lt;/strong&gt; (under accumulator of wealth) is someone with low or negative net worth. PAWs may have normal or even below average income. UAW may have high income. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not how much you make: it&amp;rsquo;s how much you keep&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAWs live below their means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAWs have budgets and stick to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of PAWs own their own businesses. Businesses are not fancy but provide solutions to basic necessities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAWs believe being financially free is more important than displaying status. &lt;strong&gt;PAWs focus on net worth. UAWs focus on status symbols&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most PAWs are self-made. They didn&amp;rsquo;t receive money from their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most PAWs are big investors, putting &lt;strong&gt;20% or more&lt;/strong&gt; of their income into savings, stocks, mutual funds or real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAWs keep their taxes low because they&amp;rsquo;re not selling investments all the time. They buy and hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most PAWs dedicate time to financial planning and regularly consult with expert professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most PAWs buy used cars and keep them for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most PAWs don&amp;rsquo;t give cash gifts to their kids, but many pay for their education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Ego Is The Enemy</title>
      <link>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/ego/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/ego/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/ego.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ego Book Cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://egoistheenemy.com/&#34;&gt;Ego Is The Enemy&lt;/a&gt;, by Ryan Holiday, came highly recommended by &lt;a href=&#34;http://sivers.org&#34;&gt;Derek Sivers&lt;/a&gt;. It explores how remaining humble and embracing a learning mindset can lead to success. Here are my favorite highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If ego is the voice that tells us we’re better than we really are, we can say ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Suppress ego early before bad habits take hold.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The ability to evaluate one’s own ability is the most important skill of all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There’s a weak side to each of us, that—like a trade union—isn’t exactly malicious but at the end of the day still wants get as much public credit and attention as it can for doing the least. That side we call ego.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What a lot of us do when we’re scared or overwhelmed by a project: everything but focus on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What you choose to do with your time and what you choose to do for money works on you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevents us from getting any better. Studious self-assessment is the antidote.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To become great you need to have someone better that you can learn from, someone lesser who you can teach, and someone equal that you can challenge yourself against.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today, books are cheaper than ever. Courses are free. Access to teachers is no longer a barrier—technology has done away with that. There is no excuse for not getting your education.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Develop a system for winning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hire professionals and use them. They ask questions, they ask what could go wrong, they ask for examples. They plan for contingencies. Then they are off to the races. Usually they get started with small steps, complete them, and look for feedback on how the next set can be better. They lock in gains, and then get better as they go, often leveraging those gains to grow exponentially rather than arithmetically.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Passion is form over function. Purpose is function, function, function.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room—until you change that with results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Help yourself by helping others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It doesn’t degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brush it off and work harder. Play the game. Ignore the noise; for the love of God, do not let it distract you. Restraint is a difficult skill but a critical one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is a timeless fact of life that the up-and-coming must endure the abuses of the entrenched.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You’re not able to change the system until after you’ve made it. In the meantime, you’ll have to find some way to make it suit your purposes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We live in a world that tells us to keep and promote a “personal brand.” We’re required to tell stories in order to sell our work and our talents, and after enough time, forget where the line is that separates our fictions from reality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be part of what’s going on around you. Feast on it, adjust for it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There’s no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Receive feedback, maintain hunger, and chart a proper course in life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you can’t swallow your pride, you can’t lead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ego has the same roots—insecurity, fear, a dislike for brutal objectivity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Man is pushed by drives,” Viktor Frankl observed. “But he is pulled by values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We must understand that we are a small part of an interconnected universe. On top of all this, we have to build an organization and a system around what we do—one that is about the work and not about us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Any man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As we first succeed, we will find ourselves in new situations, facing new problems. The freshly promoted soldier must learn the art of politics. The salesman, how to manage. The founder, how to delegate. The writer, how to edit others. The comedian, how to act. The chef turned restaurateur, how to run the other side of the house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simple but exacting standards matter more than some grand vision or power trip.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The founding of a company, making money in the market, or the formation of an idea is messy. Reducing it to a narrative retroactively creates a clarity that never was and never will be there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Competitiveness is an important force in life. It’s what drives the market and is behind some of mankind’s most impressive accomplishments. On an individual level, however, it’s absolutely critical that you know who you’re competing with and why, that you have a clear sense of the space you’re in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sit down and think about what’s truly important to you and then take steps to forsake the rest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ego says that sure, even though you’re just starting to get the hang of one thing, why not jump right in the middle of another? Eventually, you say yes to too much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some of the greatest and most dangerous delusions: entitlement, control, and paranoia.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your job is to set the priorities, to think big picture, and then trust the people beneath you to do the jobs they were hired for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When we’re aspiring or small time, we can be idiosyncratic, we can compensate for disorganization with hard work and a little luck. That’s not going to cut it in the majors. In fact, it’ll sink you if you can’t grow up and organize.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the end, we all face becoming the adult supervision we originally rebelled against.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Days become less and less about doing and more and more about making decisions. Such is the nature of leadership. This transition requires reevaluating and updating your identity. It requires a certain humility to put aside some of the more enjoyable or satisfying parts of your previous job. It means accepting that others might be more qualified or specialized in areas in which you considered yourself competent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence, on the other hand, is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creativity is a matter of receptiveness and recognition. This cannot happen if you’re convinced the world revolves around you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Churchill’s Europe required one type of leader. Today’s interconnected world requires its own. Because there is so much information to be sorted through, so much competition, so much change, without a clear head . . . all is lost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called failure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whether what you’re going through is your fault or your problem doesn’t matter, because it’s yours to deal with right now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re aspiring to much more than mere success. What matters is that we can respond to what life throws at us. And how we make it through.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It’s far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less attached we are to outcomes the better. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effort—not the results, good or bad—is enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We can’t let externals determine whether something was worth it or not. It’s on us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Doing the work is enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ask yourself: Is this the person I want to be?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shit happens and, as they say, sometimes shit happens in public. It’s not fun. The questions remain: Are you going to make it worse? Or are you going to emerge from this with your dignity and character intact? Are you going to live to fight another day?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When a team looks like they’re going to lose a game, the coach doesn’t call them all over and lie to them. Instead, he or she reminds them who they are and what they’re capable of, and urges them to go back out there and embody that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The only real failure is abandoning your principles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You’re not as good as you think. You don’t have it all figured out. Stay focused. Do better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is characteristic of how great people think: It’s not that they find failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People can get lucky and win. People can be assholes and win. Anyone can win. But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A person who can think long term doesn’t pity herself during short-term setbacks. A person who values the team can share credit and subsume his own interests in a way that most others can’t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Attempting to destroy something out of hate or ego often ensures that it will be preserved and disseminated forever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know what is a better response to an attack or a slight or something you don’t like? Love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maybe love is too much to ask for whatever it is that you’ve had done to you. You could at the very least try to let it go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;it’s so easy to hate. Hate defers blame. It makes someone else responsible. It’s a distraction too; we don’t do much else when we’re busy getting revenge or investigating the wrongs that have supposedly been done to us. Does this get us any closer to where we want to be? No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Any fool can learn from experience. The trick is to learn from other people’s experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Compound Effect</title>
      <link>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/compound/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/compound/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/compound.jpg&#34; width=&#34;150px&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than just a productivity book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thecompoundeffect.com/&#34;&gt;The Compound Effect&lt;/a&gt;, by Darren Hardy, deals with the importance of developing good habits. It is easy to read and full of valuable insights and actionable steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my most important &lt;strong&gt;takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;massive-results-take-time&#34;&gt;Massive results take time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we are trying to build wealth, lose weight, learn a new language or any other worthwhile pursuit, success only comes after small, consistent actions performed over a long period of time. Most people get discouraged because they don&amp;rsquo;t see results weeks, months or even years after they start, but eventually momentum is built and massive results begin to show. The author makes the analogy of &amp;ldquo;the penny that doubles&amp;rdquo; (if you start with a penny and double it every day, after 30 days you will have $10.7M).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-choices&#34;&gt;On Choices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the beginning, you make choices. Then, your choices make you&lt;/strong&gt;. Make good choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-owning-outcomes&#34;&gt;On Owning Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be successful you need to develop an &lt;strong&gt;owner mentality&lt;/strong&gt;. This means holding yourself 100% responsible and accountable for your outcomes. You may have done 90% of the work but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t crossed the finish line it won&amp;rsquo;t mean anything. It is not enough to your do your part. All that matters is the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-formula-for-success&#34;&gt;The Formula for Success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success = Preparation + Attitude + Opportunity + Action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be an element of luck, but when opportunity knocks you need to be prepared and ready to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;small-difference-big-payoff&#34;&gt;Small Difference, Big Payoff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The horse that wins by a nose wins 10X the price money. The soccer team who wins the championship, even with a penalty goal in extra time, gets all the glory. As you get good at what you do, you will notice that the difference between the best and the rest doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that big, but achieving that plus is the hardest part. It takes practice, preparation, consistency and good habits. That plus is why the best get paid disproportionately more than the very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-ripple-effect&#34;&gt;The Ripple Effect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small action sets in motion thousands of other small actions that make a huge difference over time. When you stop going to the gym even for one day it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much, but you are breaking momentum, which is the hardest thing to get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-power&#34;&gt;Why-Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have why-power (a goal), willpower comes easy. You need to &lt;strong&gt;know why you are doing what you are doing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;small-consistent-steps&#34;&gt;Small, Consistent Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World class performers increase difficulty a little every day. They aim for small, steady steps, consistently applied over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;avoid-instant-gratification&#34;&gt;Avoid Instant Gratification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t notice the immediate effects of eating that greasy donut or skipping a workout, but compounded over time these seemingly inconsequential actions will derail your chances of success. Think of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://personalmba.com/second-order-effects/&#34;&gt;second order effects&lt;/a&gt; of everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-not-do&#34;&gt;Be, not do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;what do I have to do to get X&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;who do I have to become to attract X&amp;rdquo;&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;momentum&#34;&gt;Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is always the hardest one. Starting wins half the battle. Before we achieve momentum we have to start. Momentum is why the rich get richer, the happy get happier and the lucky get luckier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;routine-power&#34;&gt;Routine Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routines, even trivial ones, are important because they represent small wins that keep us motivated. It is important to start and end our days with routines: make your bed, meditate, evaluate your day and set goals for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;external-influences&#34;&gt;External Influences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surround yourself with positive influences and supportive people: don&amp;rsquo;t watch news, find a mentor, assemble your own board of advisors. Look at what successful people do and do that. For example, successful people never stop learning. The most skilled musicians, public speakers, sports icons, CEOs, etc. always hire a coach to help them become better than they already are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;acceleration&#34;&gt;Acceleration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do one little thing more than your competition. Make one more phone call, send one more email, check with customers after the sale, ask for feedback to see how you can improve. This extra effort doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost much but will make a huge difference in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talk Like TED</title>
      <link>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/talkliketed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/talkliketed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/ted.jpg&#34; width=&#34;150px&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was rehearsing a presentation, and one of my co-workers recorded it on video. What an eye opener! I was terrible&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting some honest feedback and a few tips, and going through the presentation for five or six more times, my delivery got better, to the point that I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t have to cringe when I watched it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if fate had it, a few days later I was at a Fedex store and saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.carminegallo.com/books/talk-like-ted/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talk Like TED&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Carmine Gallo, sitting on the shelves. I went to my local library and picked it up. Here are my most important takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good presentation is:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional (touch the heart)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Novel (teach something new)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memorable (you&amp;rsquo;ll never forget)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Stories are &amp;ldquo;data with a soul&amp;rdquo;&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm up your audience with stories, before you throw around statistics. &lt;strong&gt;Start with a story they can relate to&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;three types of stories&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About brand success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;story arch&lt;/strong&gt; goes like this: at the beginning everything is fine; then something bad happens; then the bad is overcome and victory ensues. Every good story follows more or less that trajectory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three things to do &lt;strong&gt;before a good presentation&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get brutal feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reherase, rehearse, rehearse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;four elements&lt;/strong&gt; that you must incorporate into your verbal delivery:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflections, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pauses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ideal speaking speed when you deliver a presentation is &lt;strong&gt;190 words/minute&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you present, try to &lt;strong&gt;act and look like a leader&lt;/strong&gt;: looks, poise, confidence, matter almost as much as your content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gestures are important. Hand movements are necessary, but for maximum effectiveness you need to use them sparingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your hand movements within your &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;power sphere&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;: the arch between your eyes, your extended arms and your waist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other &lt;strong&gt;Do&amp;rsquo;s and Dont&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t juggle, tap or jingle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t stand still. &lt;strong&gt;Move!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t put both hands in your pocket&lt;/strong&gt;. One hand is OK, provided that the other one is moving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Dopamine is your brain&amp;rsquo;s SAVE button&lt;/mark&gt;. When the brain releases dopamine, people remember more. You need to help your audience release dopamine with compelling stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get more story ideas submit yourself to &lt;strong&gt;new experiences&lt;/strong&gt;, i.e. travel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must have &lt;strong&gt;ONE key message&lt;/strong&gt;: there must be one key point you want to make, and you need to be able to express it in a &amp;ldquo;Twitter headline&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;(140 characters or less)&lt;/strong&gt;. If you can&amp;rsquo;t, keep refining your idea. Being able to articulate your point briefly and concisely will help your audience to better process your content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &lt;strong&gt;jaw-dropping moments&lt;/strong&gt;: present the information in a way nobody has done it before (remember &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_unplugged&#34;&gt;Bill Gates releasing mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; to the audience before his talk about malaria?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find &lt;strong&gt;tangible comparisons to hard to understand numbers&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re talking about BP&amp;rsquo;s oil spill, talk in terms of how many olympic size pools of oil were leaked, as oppossed to gallons. Steve Jobs did this brilliantly when he launched the ipod, talking about 1,000 songs in your pocket, instead of Megabytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End on a high note, and &lt;strong&gt;leave the audience wanting to know more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;using humor&lt;/strong&gt;, try to use:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal anecdotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analogies and metaphors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Videos and photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;18 Minute Rule&lt;/strong&gt;: there is a reason why TED talks are 18 minutes long. It is the optimal length if you want the audience to be engaged and remember what you said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer presentations require a break or a change of pace (perhaps incorporating a video in between your talk) &lt;strong&gt;every 10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the &lt;strong&gt;Rule of Three&lt;/strong&gt;: people remember and make sense of blocks of three concepts at a time. Throw in more and they won&amp;rsquo;t process them as well. Some examples of the Rule of Three are: &amp;ldquo;Good, Better, Best&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Eat, Pray, Love&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Small, Medium, Large&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Three Story Structure&lt;/strong&gt;: this is a very effective technique, used by the best presenters. You have &lt;strong&gt;ONE key point&lt;/strong&gt; supported by &lt;strong&gt;three key messages&lt;/strong&gt;, and each of those three key messages is supported by &lt;strong&gt;stories, statistics and examples&lt;/strong&gt;. Watch &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/&#34;&gt;Steve&amp;rsquo;s Job commencement address&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford and see if you can figure out his main point and key messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;multi-sensory experience&lt;/strong&gt;: try to incorporate props and visual aids into your presentation. Remember: pictures are better than bullet points, videos are better than pictures, and things/people are better than videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay in your lane: Basically, &lt;strong&gt;be authentic&lt;/strong&gt; and don&amp;rsquo;t bullshit. Know what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, don&amp;rsquo;t give that talk, or keep practicing. Don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fake it &amp;rsquo;til you make it&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;fake it &amp;rsquo;til you become it&lt;/mark&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>A Guide to the Good Life</title>
      <link>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/stoic/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/stoic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/stoic.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100px&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally managed to read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.williambirvine.com/&#34;&gt;A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by William B. Irvine. The book came highly recommended by Derek Sivers, an artist and writer that I respect and identify with due to our almost identical world views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had only a vague idea of what stoicism was prior to reading the book, but based on my little knowledge I suspected that I have been practicing, albeit unknowingly, many of the tenets of this philosophy. Reading the book confirmed my theory, and introduced me to some new tools and techniques to improve the way I live. Here are &lt;strong&gt;10 key ideas&lt;/strong&gt; of the book that I highlighted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objective of Stoicism is to enable you to live a good life by pursuing &lt;strong&gt;tranquility&lt;/strong&gt; (defined as the absence of negative emotions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stoicism teaches us to use our &lt;strong&gt;reasoning ability&lt;/strong&gt; to banish negative emotions like anger, grief, and envy. Rational people will find Stoicism easier to practice than overly emotional people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stoicism recommends the practice of &amp;ldquo;negative visualization&amp;rdquo;, basically to imagine how would life be if we lose the things or people we value. By engaging in negative visualization we diminish the anguish and grief of loss in two ways: first, because whatever happens we will be expecting it, and second, because it teaches us to be grateful for the things we still have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to master the &amp;ldquo;trichotomy of control&amp;rdquo;, by recognizing the three categories of things: 1) Things over which we have complete control, 2) Things over which we have no control at all, and 3) Things over which we have some but not complete control. We should only concern ourselves with things over which we have complete control, or some level of control. It is useless to worry about things over which we don&amp;rsquo;t have control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along those lines, Stoicism teaches us to choose &amp;ldquo;internal goals&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;external goals&amp;rdquo;. For example, if we&amp;rsquo;re playing a game of tennis, our goal should be to play our best tennis possible, and not to win the game. By internalizing his goals, the Stoic is able to preserve his tranquility while dealing with things over which he has only partial control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stoicism teaches us that the key to being wealthy is not to have a lot but to &lt;strong&gt;need very little&lt;/strong&gt;. Stoics don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily reject material wealth. They enjoy it but they don&amp;rsquo;t cling to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stoics prepare to lose their wealth by regularly practicing &amp;ldquo;voluntary discomfort&amp;rdquo;. The most likely result of practicing this technique is that we will soon notice how little do we really need to live a happy, productive life. Some things we can practice on a regular basis are to eat simply prioritizing nutrition over pleasure, get rid of non-essential possessions and practice minimalism, take public transportation instead of our car, sleep in couches, take cold showers, etc. These are minor things that we will get used to and learn to enjoy with time. Because they have learned to enjoy things that are easily obtainable or that can’t be taken from them, Stoics will find much in life to enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stoics recognize that our anger about something is usually worse and lasts longer than the damage done to us, therefore we should &lt;strong&gt;avoid getting angry&lt;/strong&gt;. To get rid of anger we should practice putting things in their right perspective. For example, we can ask ourselves: &amp;ldquo;will this really matter in 100 years?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stoics value their &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt;, and they are therefore reluctant to do anything that will give others power over them. If we seek social status, we give other people power over us. That is why as Stoics we must become indifferent to other people’s opinions of us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must train ourselves to not hold grudges or consider ourselves a victim. If we consider ourselves victims, we are not going to have a good life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Anything You Want</title>
      <link>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/ayw/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/ayw.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;AYW Cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/a&#34;&gt;Anything You Want&lt;/a&gt; by Derek Sivers is a powerful little book offering valuable uncommon sense advice on how to approach business in alignment with your values and beliefs. In about an hour reading time, Derek Sivers candidly tells us everything he learned from founding, operating and selling CD Baby, the business he stumbled upon when he decided to help fellow musicians sell their work on the Internet in the pre-Paypal, pre-iTunes days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-highlights-and-notes&#34;&gt;My Highlights and Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need to know your personal philosophy of what makes you happy and what&amp;rsquo;s worth doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Business is not about money. It&amp;rsquo;s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what&amp;rsquo;s not working.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your business plan is moot. You don&amp;rsquo;t know what people really want until you start doing it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t need money to start helping people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to make a big business. I was just daydreaming about how one little thing would look in a perfect world.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you control all the laws. This is your utopia.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A business plan should never take more than a few hours of work.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The best plans start simple. A quick glance and common sense should tell you if the numbers will work. The rest are details.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revolution is a term that people use only when you&amp;rsquo;re successful. Before that, you&amp;rsquo;re just a quirky person who does things differently.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Present each new idea or improvement to the world. If multiple people are saying, &amp;ldquo;Wow! Yes! I need this! I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to pay you to do this!&amp;rdquo; then you should probably do it. But if the response is anything less, don&amp;rsquo;t pursue it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re not saying &amp;ldquo;HELL YEAH!&amp;rdquo; about something, say &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say &amp;ldquo;HELL YEAH!&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Any time you think you know what your new business will be doing, remember this quote from Steve Blank: No plan survives first contact with customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By not having any money to waste, you never waste money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Absolutely everything you do is for your customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Make every decision-even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone-according to what&amp;rsquo;s best for your customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;None of your customers will ask you to turn your attention to expanding. They want you to keep your attention focused on them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The way to grow your business is to focus entirely on your existing customers. Just thrill them, and they&amp;rsquo;ll tell everyone.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For an idea to get big big big, it has to be useful. And being useful doesn&amp;rsquo;t need funding.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you want to be useful, you can always start now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Starting small puts 100 percent of your energy on actually solving real problems for real people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never forget that there are thousands of businesses, like Jim&amp;rsquo;s Fish Bait Shop in a shack on a beach somewhere, that are doing just fine without corporate formalities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you do land the big client, that organization will practically own you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By trying so hard to please the big client, you will lose touch with what the rest of the world wants. Instead, imagine that you have designed your business to have NO big clients, just lots of little clients.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you build your business on serving thousands of customers, not dozens, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about any one customer leaving or making special demands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need to confidently exclude people, and proudly say what you&amp;rsquo;re not. By doing so, you will win the hearts of the people you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a big world. You can loudly leave out 99 percent of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you&amp;rsquo;ve shown how much you value them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never forget why you&amp;rsquo;re really doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn&amp;rsquo;t that enough?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We all grade ourselves by different measures: For me, it&amp;rsquo;s how many useful things I create, whether songs, companies, articles, websites, or anything else.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem was truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can keep solving it for a fee.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Any business that&amp;rsquo;s in business to sell you a cure is motivated not to focus on prevention.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Care about your customers more than about yourself, and you&amp;rsquo;ll do well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you set up your business like you don&amp;rsquo;t need the money, people are happier to pay you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When someone&amp;rsquo;s doing something for the money, people can sense it, like a desperate lover. It&amp;rsquo;s a turnoff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t prevent bad things from happening. Learn to shrug.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s often the tiny details that really thrill people enough to make them tell all their friends about you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you find even the smallest way to make people smile, they&amp;rsquo;ll remember you more for that smile than for all your other fancy business-model stuff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to tell what someone&amp;rsquo;s going to be like on the job until he&amp;rsquo;s actually on the job for a few weeks. So I&amp;rsquo;d hire lightly and fire lightly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to impress an invisible jury of MBA professors. It&amp;rsquo;s OK to be casual.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a benefit to being naive about the norms of the world: deciding from scratch what seems like the right thing to do, instead of just doing what others do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No matter what business you&amp;rsquo;re in, it&amp;rsquo;s good to prepare for what would happen if business doubled. &amp;ldquo;More of the same&amp;rdquo; is never the answer. You&amp;rsquo;d have to do things in a new way to handle twice as much business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about being, not having.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The whole point of doing anything is because it makes you happy! That&amp;rsquo;s it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I never again promised a customer that I could do something that was beyond my full control.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I got myself into the delegation mindset. I had to make myself unnecessary to the running of my company.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a big difference between being self-employed and being a business owner. Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles. To be a true business owner, make sure you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can make your role anything you want it to be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anything you hate to do, someone else loves. So find that person and let him do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Huge growth means lots of meetings, investors, bankers, media, and answering to others. It&amp;rsquo;s quite far from the real core of the business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t every business want to be as big as possible? No. Make sure you know what makes you happy, and don&amp;rsquo;t forget it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trust, but verify. Remember it when delegating. You have to do both. Delegate, but don&amp;rsquo;t abdicate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s such a thing as over-delegation. I had empowered my employees so much that I gave them all the power. After a complete communication breakdown, it was eight-five people (my employees) against one (me).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I learned an important word: abdicate. To abdicate means to surrender or relinquish power or responsibility; this word is usually used when a king abdicates the throne or crown. Lesson learned too late: Delegate, but don&amp;rsquo;t abdicate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I realized that the bigger learning and growing challenge for me was letting go, not staying on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I let two companies bid, and ended up choosing the one that bid the lowest but understood my clients better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The less I own, the happier I am. The lack of stuff gives me the priceless freedom to live anywhere anytime. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m altruistic. I&amp;rsquo;m sacrificing nothing. I&amp;rsquo;ve just learned what makes me happy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You make your perfect world. Business is as creative as the fine arts. You can be as unconventional, unique, and quirky as you want. A business is a reflection of the creator.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No matter which goal you choose, there will be lots of people telling you you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. Just pay close attention to what excites you and what drains you. Pay close attention to when you&amp;rsquo;re being the real you and when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to impress an invisible jury.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If it makes you happy, that&amp;rsquo;s OK. It&amp;rsquo;s your choice to remain small.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work The System</title>
      <link>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/systems/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/wts.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;WTS Cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.workthesystem.com/get-the-book-free/&#34;&gt;Work The System&lt;/a&gt; when it was highly recommended by two respected business thinkers that I follow online: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joshkaufman.net&#34;&gt;Josh Kaufman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sebastianmarshall.com&#34;&gt;Sebastian Marshall&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been very busy lately and a deep understanding of systems, standardization and automation will bring more control, less stress, and more time for value-adding activities like thinking, strategizing, and staying healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint, and left me with plenty of actionable steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hereby summarize the main tenets of the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The systems of the world work perfectly 99.9% of the time:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyday systems like air travel or electricity delivery almost never fail. We&amp;rsquo;ve become so used to it that we have come to expect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Businesses are machines:&lt;/strong&gt; Like their mechanical counterparts, businesses have moving parts that operate in a linear 1-2-3 fashion. If a business sub-system is not working properly, we can isolate it, fix it and put everything back together, just like we would with a physical machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large corporations operate with systems.  Small businesses improvise:&lt;/strong&gt; The reason multi-billion dollar companies grow and expand is the relentless implementation of systems. For small business owners, though, systems implementation is low in the scale of priorities. Those who are able to take the leap and embrace systems thinking will be orders of magnitude more successful than those who don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are all project engineers. Our job is to create, fix and maintain systems:&lt;/strong&gt; This may come as a paradigm shift for most of us. By rethinking the way we work and redefining our role to project engineer (designing and repairing systems for a living) our productivity (and our sanity, I may add) will improve exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;98% perfection:&lt;/strong&gt;  Borrowed from Pareto&amp;rsquo;s 80-20 rule, the author convincingly argues that 98% good is as well as perfect, since the remaining 2% would take too much time and effort for the benefit it would bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Errors of omission:&lt;/strong&gt; Failures are not usually the consequence of overt mistakes but simply that somebody neglected or forgot something.  This is perhaps one of the most powerful arguments in favor of systems: if a process is thoroughly documented and followed, the chances of things going wrong will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiet courage:&lt;/strong&gt; Taking a cue from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stevenpressfield.com/&#34;&gt;Steven Pressfield&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s books, the author urges us to beat the resistance by sticking to the plan no matter what, even when we dont feel like it.  He calls this quality &amp;ldquo;quiet courage&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point of sale thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; An analogy to describe the  habit of doing things at once, by either doing them ourselves or delegating them. As in POS systems, where different business sub-systems are updated instantly the moment a sale is recorded, our habit of doing things at once will make a positive difference on our business in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singles and doubles, not home runs:&lt;/strong&gt; Superb results are not the consequence of genius or bursts of inspiration, but of small, deliberate and consistent incremental improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these concepts lead us to the most important part of the book: the introduction of the three essential documents. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Operating Principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Operating Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of these three life changing tools, the &lt;strong&gt;Operating Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;, are what make the day to day of a business go flawlessly. They are the detailed written instructions on how the different tasks and activities are to be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objective&lt;/strong&gt; states what you aim for (your vision and long term goals), while the &lt;strong&gt;Operating Principles&lt;/strong&gt; serve as a guideline for decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help us internalize the concept, the author draws an interesting analogy: think of the Strategic Objective as the &lt;strong&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/strong&gt;, the Operating Principles as the &lt;strong&gt;Constitution&lt;/strong&gt;, and the Operating Procedures as the &lt;strong&gt;laws&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this book remarkable, aside from the usefulness of its content, is the deep personal connection between the author and the concepts he lays out. Sam Carpenter credits the systems mindset for rescuing him from near burnout and 80-hour workweeks, and leading him to a more relaxed, productive life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is also very well structured, half textbook/half biography, turning what would otherwise be a dry, tedious subject into an engaging read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ikigai</title>
      <link>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/ikigai/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mariosanchez.org/booknotes/ikigai/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/ikigai.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Marshall put together this book in a week (mostly from blog content) as a dare to an old-school publisher who had offered to publish it but had been dragging the project for months. As a result, some passages may sound repetitive and there are several grammatical and spelling errors, but don&amp;rsquo;t get fooled: there is gold on those pages if you just can see beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlights:898f2c2967af6916fd60f5a6d754f990&#34;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Walk the center path with other people&amp;rsquo;s objectives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want everyone who connects with me to be better off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;90% of the people I draw up plans for, plans that would clearly work, don&amp;rsquo;t act on them. It&amp;rsquo;s like everyone fantasizes about &amp;lsquo;whatever&amp;rsquo; but once their fantasies start to become reality, they piss their pants and self-sabotage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;High quality paper is a super hack to come across as ultra-professional.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do a bunch of stuff that might work, and won&amp;rsquo;t hurt too bad if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Identify what makes people succeed at a massively high level. Do that. If that&amp;rsquo;s not working, go back to step and try again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen to audiobooks and learning while doing other things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I must be neutral, study even successful people I don&amp;rsquo;t like. My mind should not become an echo chamber.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Greatness is not something you are, it&amp;rsquo;s something you do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;Serve, build, inspire, connect, defend, protect, establish, write, experiment, teach, help&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start building skills, resources, experiences, and mobility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Read the sequences on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lesswrong.com&#34;&gt;LessWrong&lt;/a&gt;, click sequences, read almost all of them. These will teach you how to think better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go to Wikipedia once a week, and put in a historical leader or era of history, and start reading.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s possible unless you study history.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re taking general university courses, take accounting. It&amp;rsquo;s really useful, but it&amp;rsquo;s too boring to self-study.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start learning general social skills. I recommend you read How to Win Friends and Influence People, but don&amp;rsquo;t read it cover to cover. Instead, read one chapter per week, and then practice the ideas from it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn how to negotiate. Read books on negotiation. I think Critical Conversations is probably the best one to start with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never, ever, ever get into debt. Just don&amp;rsquo;t do it. If you have debt (student loans, credit cars, etc), pay them off as soon as you have any cash at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;Debt cripples a man&amp;rsquo;s ability to do what he wants with his life&lt;/mark&gt;. Stay away from it at all costs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Train yourself to do arithmetic fast. There&amp;rsquo;s more value in being able to add, subtract, divide, and do percents fast than in any other kind of math.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start filling up your dead time. Bring a book or audio with you when you&amp;rsquo;re running errands, commuting, things like that. Life is precious, either explicitly relax, or do something valuable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This one is big, start listening to audio if you don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start building skills, credentials, money, contacts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, what are your larger roles? It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to pick. It&amp;rsquo;s not like a minute exercise. It&amp;rsquo;s something you go to a cafe with a notebook and pen and sit there staring at the page with a coffee, thinking for an hour. Even one hour isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. You do the think-with-coffee thing dozens of times, hundreds of times if you need to, trying to discover what matters to you, what you can dedicate yourself to, what&amp;rsquo;s important, what works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s many ways to live a good and meaningful life, but I think one of the most important steps is to think on what a good and meaningful life would be to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;If/when you do know what matters most to you, then the rest of the points are just cost/benefit, expected value, planning, forecasting, things like that&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In a world where marketing and advertising exists, you need to do it because that&amp;rsquo;s the equilibrium. If you fight against equilibriums, you lose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;High happinesses: triumph, camaraderie, epiphany, wisdom. Those I think are worth pursuing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Depending on how much you&amp;rsquo;ve traveled and studied different eras of history, you probably have lots of views about &amp;ldquo;the way things are&amp;rdquo; that isn&amp;rsquo;t actually the way things are. Just your culture at this particular moment in history.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While you&amp;rsquo;re learning, start building. Eventually you&amp;rsquo;re going to find causes that matter to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I chase meaning, the happiness and fun largely takes care of itself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Distribution and marketing are of core importance to business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When someone eats, sleeps, breathes, walks, works, lives with one purpose, he will usually achieve that purpose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be grateful to the scientists and engineers and inventors and builders and artists that came before us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By doing an action repeatedly, eventually you become the kind of person who does that action. If you repeatedly ask, &amp;ldquo;What can I do to come across as helpful?&amp;rdquo; and execute on that, then you become a helpful person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spread the good around, it&amp;rsquo;ll catch up with you sooner or later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s virtuous and appropriate to build wealth and become powerful. Expect to be treated well. Be friendly, giving, and helpful and don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything in return. Yet, when you&amp;rsquo;ve got something of value, offer good deals and get compensated. Don&amp;rsquo;t define yourself by money and possessions. There&amp;rsquo;s an unlimited amount of wealth and power available, you can gain it by building, inventing, innovating, cooperating, trading, and doing other virtuous things. Don&amp;rsquo;t be stingy and scramble for the last penny, leave something on the table. But don&amp;rsquo;t be too shy either, build and receive a lot in return.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t define yourself by money and possessions. There&amp;rsquo;s an unlimited amount of wealth and power available, you can gain it by building, inventing, innovating, cooperating, trading, and doing other virtuous things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Expect to be treated well, and act accordingly. Have a calm expectancy that people will agree to do things your way. Don&amp;rsquo;t argue or get upset, but do calmly insist that things be done correctly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sell some things you produce, sell some of your skills, get paid. It&amp;rsquo;s cool to ask people for money as long as you know you can deliver x the value of what you&amp;rsquo;re being paid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The victors: the ones who build the really enduring victories, they&amp;rsquo;re often not the most brilliant or charismatic or brave. They&amp;rsquo;re the ones who are most patient, who are most rational, who have the most self-control.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are seven emotions: joy, anger, anxiety, love, grief, fear, and hate, and if a man does not give way to these he can be called patient.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m scared sometimes of giving way to being joyful. It is a good thing to feel joyful, but not to let joy dull your edge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of the common virtues, the successful seem to have an immense amount of loyalty and reverence for the people that &amp;ldquo;got them there,&amp;rdquo; revering and celebrating them even as they bring more and more people to their banner. The people who break from their early friends and supporters usually end poorly, in an isolation of their own making.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The people who break from their early friends and supporters usually end poorly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By taking great care of the people who elevated you from the beginning, you build a stronger foundation that&amp;rsquo;s worthy of respect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Two kinds of ways trade and interact and cooperate. The first way would be through &amp;ldquo;market norms&amp;rdquo;, this is where two people clearly agree to make an exchange, and deliver what they agreed to exchange, and the deal is concluded. The second way is through &amp;ldquo;social norms&amp;rdquo;, where you&amp;rsquo;re looking out for each other&amp;rsquo;s best interests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Derek Sivers wrote a review of Predictably Irrational (&lt;a href=&#34;http://sivers.org/book/PredictablyIrrational&#34;&gt;http://sivers.org/book/PredictablyIrrational&lt;/a&gt;) that I highly recommend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Market norms push out social norms. But I&amp;rsquo;ve started to wonder if this can be avoided by always leaving something on the table. This means getting away from haggling, grinding up/down to the absolute final price someone would pay, and hard selling. For my work, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be aiming to generate a x return on investment over the the next three years. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s %. I think that&amp;rsquo;s the first part, looking out for their interests and not grinding.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good negotiation is about figuring out what you can offer that&amp;rsquo;s worth more to the other person than you, and what they can offer that&amp;rsquo;s worth more to you than them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re selling, the deal or product you offer should seem like a fantastically good value, like your service existing is a favor to the person doing business with you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you want to stay away from exchange-based feelings, be very enjoyable to work with. Figure out what your client or provider&amp;rsquo;s highest-level goals are, and help them get it. Pay well if you&amp;rsquo;re buying, over-deliver to a ridiculous extent so it&amp;rsquo;s clear you&amp;rsquo;re above and beyond the call if you&amp;rsquo;re selling. And make it enjoyable, really enjoyable, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need to make everyone look good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Make people look good to the people they really care about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looking out for people outside of the scope of the deal can help make it about more than just the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I never liked spending money on comfort or luxury that doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve a higher purpose. I eat very simply, I sleep simply, I don&amp;rsquo;t need or want much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to sacrifice and suffer and martyr myself when I help people. I ask for feedback.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Make connecting with people part of my entertainment time. You know, when most people are watching TV, I&amp;rsquo;m reading email, writing email, hopping on the phone with people, answering questions, helping other people do strategy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I added a note to my daily checklist for a while, &amp;ldquo;Reach out to someone&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;Make connecting with people part of your entertainment time&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start by sending out short (the shorter the better) emails to people who you see saying or doing something cool. Even if they don&amp;rsquo;t write back, I guarantee they appreciate it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Embarrassment and errors are part of doing meaningful things. It&amp;rsquo;s not such a big deal, really.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Embarrassment? Dude, eternity stretches before and after us. Embarrassment is your neurochemistry in a mildly uncomfortable position. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good Marketing Is Mostly Just Having People Want to Spend Time With You.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When someone spends their time with me, whatever the medium, that&amp;rsquo;s a tremendous honor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good marketing goes, &amp;ldquo;This person could be anywhere else, let&amp;rsquo;s make it worth their while.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The rest of good marketing is offering people something worth many, many times more than what you&amp;rsquo;re charging.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tell people what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and let them decide if it&amp;rsquo;s right for them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;The first step to being a great marketer is respecting your own time&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The quintessential, alpha-omega principle of strategy, which is - Do things for reasons.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not simply &amp;ldquo;do shit&amp;rdquo; for no reason.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The way to start doing that is to ask, &amp;ldquo;What is my objective here?&amp;rdquo; Then, &amp;ldquo;What course of action makes me most likely to reach that objective?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ask, &amp;ldquo;What is my objective here? What gives me the best chance of reaching it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maybe the biggest problem really intelligent people have is that they spend more time being clever than being effective.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take a quick look, get an understanding, choose one. Change later if it becomes an issue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using words people don&amp;rsquo;t know maybe makes you seem clever, but makes you much less clear and less effective.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Proving someone wrong? Yeah, clever. Very ineffective, though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Winning by a huge margin can make people stupid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After victory, tighten the straps on your helmet.&amp;rdquo; Tokugawa Ieyasu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re writing a piece, you have to make sure the title, introduction, images, and formatting all fit the expectations and heuristics of the people who you care about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People will skim your work. You need to take that into account, and make good transitions, sub-headlines, intelligently use bolding and links, and otherwise make sure the people of your target audience get the message. If they don&amp;rsquo;t get it, that means YOU didn&amp;rsquo;t get it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Keep learning marketing and buyer&amp;rsquo;s psychology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never ever ever ever say, &amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t get it&amp;rdquo; if you care about the person who just made that decision. No, you don&amp;rsquo;t get it. You did it wrong. Learn. Figure out where the decision/reaction came from, and do it better next time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Most people don&amp;rsquo;t distinguish between observing and judging.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Strip your observations down to cause and effect. &amp;ldquo;X seems to have happened, what caused it? Perhaps Y, perhaps Z. Let&amp;rsquo;s observe some more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) Ask ourselves what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve;  (b) Ask ourselves how we could tell if we achieved it (&amp;ldquo;what does it look like to be a good comedian?&amp;rdquo;) and how we can track progress;  &amp;copy; Find ourselves strongly, intrinsically curious about information that would help us achieve our goal;  (d) Gather that information (e.g., by asking as how folks commonly achieve our goal, or similar goals, or by tallying which strategies have and haven&amp;rsquo;t worked for us in the past);  (e) Systematically test many different conjectures for how to achieve the goals, including methods that aren&amp;rsquo;t habitual for us, while tracking which ones do and don&amp;rsquo;t work;  (f) Focus most of the energy that &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; going into systematic exploration, on the methods that work best; (g) Make sure that our &amp;ldquo;goal&amp;rdquo; is really our goal, that we coherently want it and are not constrained by fears or by uncertainty as to whether it is worth the effort, and that we have thought through any questions and decisions in advance so they won&amp;rsquo;t continually sap our energies; (h) Use environmental cues and social contexts to bolster our motivation, so we can keep working effectively in the face of intermittent frustrations, or temptations based in hyperbolic discounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;If you choose to make one thing your goal, then you&amp;rsquo;re choosing not to make something else your goal&lt;/mark&gt;. You have to prioritize, or you&amp;rsquo;ll be stuck serving multiple masters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You might need natural talent to win at a zero-sum game, or if you&amp;rsquo;re competing for limited pieces of pie. But you don&amp;rsquo;t need natural talent for positive sum games. Positive sum games make multiple winners and expand the pie more than what the person eats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Constantly improve fundamentals Look for synergies in other fields Regularly complete attempts to do significant work (and ideally ship them). Just cross-reference two important disciplines that haven&amp;rsquo;t talked to each other enough yet, BAM, genius-quality work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d rank effectiveness, desire, and consistency/persistence all higher than intelligence for tangible success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve got to be working on your long term objectives almost daily, or at least weekly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you want to have a successful life, expose yourself to as much high-upside low-downside probability as you can.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Read books, reach out to people, try to get projects working, keep trying to write and build things, keep learning new skills, keep treating people well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Want to write a great book? Free yourself to write a bad book first.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Something that is not done at that time at that place will remain unfinished for a lifetime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once you do start doing lots of interesting and engaging things, then it becomes a lot easier to meet and connect with people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll have mentors, colleagues, collaborators, people who want to hire you after you produce some good stuff, not before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spend time in nature, exercise, do some breathing, listen to good classical music or rock music, eat healthy, get enough sleep, take vitamins, maybe do some martial arts or yoga or something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you hear someone speak at a conference, or tell you about their favorite project, or serve a beautiful dish in front of you, you&amp;rsquo;re seeing them at their peak. A lot of success sucks. You see the sprezzatura. You see the concert, not the setting up of the stage. Not the practicing until your hands hurt. Not the cleanup of the filthy area afterwards. Not the time touring in little nightclubs where nobody is actually watching you play, and nobody cares, and you&amp;rsquo;re kind of low and tired and strung out but gotta go play to a crowd of nine people anyways and make it good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The light easy breezy passion is kind of an illusion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The difference between a generalist and a dabbler is just saying &amp;ldquo;this is as done as it&amp;rsquo;s going to be&amp;rdquo; and shipping.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The dabbler moves on when things get tough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By shipping, you have a chance to win. If you don&amp;rsquo;t ship, you don&amp;rsquo;t win. You don&amp;rsquo;t even lose. You don&amp;rsquo;t get the lessons, the feedback, or connect with other people in the field. You don&amp;rsquo;t get the satisfaction and boost that comes from shipping.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People expect their passion to hit them in the head someday, then they&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo;, and then they&amp;rsquo;re driven and motivated and ready to go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is how you discover passions: Take a crack at it once and see if you like it at all. Then start studying and improving your craft, and see if you like that too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So that&amp;rsquo;s the first thing, I think, about passion: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from sitting and thinking about it, it comes from diving in and getting dirty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Passions are probably even harder to guess from just reading a book to know that you enjoy it, you do need to jump in, try some stuff, ship some stuff, and see what happens.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Produce and ship stuff. Even tiny tiny things. If you get into a new kind of music, write up your thoughts and first impressions on it either on a blog, or even just Amazon reviews. The mindset shift from being a consumer to being a producer is huge, even if what you produce doesn&amp;rsquo;t see all that much use at first.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you have a sincere interest, then why not try to write an analysis or critique or user guide or quick-start manual or observations or something? Producing, shipping, it&amp;rsquo;s cool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not that getting your package  days from now instead of makes such a big difference in all cases. Much of the time, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. But when it matters, it really matters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cognitive cost: if the man is thinking about the fence, he&amp;rsquo;s not thinking about something else.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;If you want to make excellent stuff, you need to make a lot of crap&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In order to do high impact excellent work, you have to do a lot of work, which includes low impact not excellent work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I commit to doing it every day, every single day no matter what.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My audience is whoever likes it, the site is written for me. If someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it at this point in their life, they&amp;rsquo;re not my audience for now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you have a good idea, write it down. I have a &amp;ldquo;shorttermblog.txt&amp;rdquo; on the desktop of my laptop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every single day, write something. Even something small.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start noticing what people like, and tweaking your works.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tone is hard to get, but it comes with time. Every single day is the way. Something, even just a quote. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the theme later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quantity Always Trumps Quality&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no real risk to trying a high upside no downside endeavor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t I make a habit of writing letters to people I respect and do it all the time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Put up a basic webpage offering some sort of consulting at some bargain rate with an explanation of why it&amp;rsquo;s so cheap and then go hustle to get that work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shifting your time from watching random TV to trying to do something creative is almost a guaranteed win.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I could give you some tactical guidelines on this question: how do you become a faster decision maker? But that&amp;rsquo;s probably not the real question we&amp;rsquo;re grappling with. Is that the real question though? Make sure the underlying issue is not that you are afraid of failing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;Define &amp;ldquo;adequately complete&amp;rdquo;&lt;/mark&gt;, then ask, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the fastest way to adequately complete?&amp;rdquo; Then do that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Slightly better&amp;rdquo; often takes twice as long, for very little gain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Consult, advise, or work for other people. It&amp;rsquo;s damn near impossible to evaluate your own projects correctly you get emotionally attached, you get stupid, you get blindsided. This still happens to me. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do consulting forever, just so I&amp;rsquo;m working with other people and can be more clear-headed than when I&amp;rsquo;m doing my own thing. Whenever you give great advice to someone else about how much time to put into something or their decision making choices, write a note in your journal or diary and refer to it later when making the same decision.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve just got to become comfortable with failing more often.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start the day with 20 minutes planning the day and working for an hour on his most important thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To take better actions, you need to gradually establish better habits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Environment matters. A lot. You can get pretty big pushes from moving your environment around to suit your goals and life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go up to tons of people, a potential lover, a boss, a cashier, a traveler, a tourist, a friend you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen for years, etc. and accept any outcome. When you let go of your ego (wants, desires, your self identity, etc.) and accept the situation for what it is, then you&amp;rsquo;re able to take as many chances as you&amp;rsquo;d like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn small talk, learn charm, learn confidence. The only way to learn those is by exposure!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I set goals every week. I aim for a 70% success rate. That means I fall short on 30% of my goals every week. I figure, if I succeeded at 100% my goals weren&amp;rsquo;t set high enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Something going wrong is an expensive lesson I already paid for. Might as well take it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of good time for details. But there&amp;rsquo;s one bad time: that&amp;rsquo;s when you&amp;rsquo;re paying attention to details instead of taking the big actions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;Narrow it down to the bare minimum you need to do to get started. Do that&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Action first. Then details.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you decide to make a big change in your life, like starting a daily life tracking routine, your best chance of success is to start with a small change and slowly expand it into something bigger. If you disrupt the status quo too much too quickly, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t stick with it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After you&amp;rsquo;ve met your goal for a specific area, continue tracking it for a few weeks until you&amp;rsquo;re confident that you&amp;rsquo;ve made it a long term habit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you&amp;rsquo;re having a highly creative day, run it out as much as you can. Resist the temptation to say, &amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s enough&amp;rdquo; and just go chill out or whatever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Normal life during normal times. &lt;mark&gt;Milk the cow as much as possible when things are unusually great. Fundamentals and trying to avoid being stupid when things are bad&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trying to improve 30 things at once is a great formula for falling off a cliff and getting nothing done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Useful skills: Writing, negotiating, speaking, conflict resolution, do basic arithmetic fast, probability and statistics, project management.&lt;br /&gt;
Work hard on tangible stuff, document and claim credit for doing it, and notify people with what benefit the work provides.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Prepare a BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement). If they say no, what will you do? You need to know this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t work with idiots. You can&amp;rsquo;t appeal to their interest, because they&amp;rsquo;re too stupid to have interests.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that kissing the ass of someone you don&amp;rsquo;t like and blindly hoping things are going to get better will result in a good life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Correspond with 100 new people per month, help them out at no cost, while simultaneously keeping up correspondence with 20 to 50 &amp;ldquo;core people&amp;rdquo; in my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My entertainment is reading, writing, and connecting with smart people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pitch Anything&amp;rdquo; by Oren Klaff, &amp;ldquo;Winning Through Intimidation&amp;rdquo; by Robert Ringer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;High variance strategy will produce huge wins or spectacular failures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thinking strategically. Very few people do this. This is saying, &amp;ldquo;What am I trying to accomplish?&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;What should I do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do I stand for?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone will value my time extremely highly, treat me very well, I&amp;rsquo;ll deliver the highest level of service and ability that I can to them, they&amp;rsquo;ll honor that and use it immediately, I&amp;rsquo;ll be treated with extreme respect and gratitude, I&amp;rsquo;ll be extremely grateful too, we&amp;rsquo;ll buy gifts for each other, I won&amp;rsquo;t accept any pay from someone that they don&amp;rsquo;t willingly excitedly give.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;Any simple deal can be written in one page&lt;/mark&gt;. If it&amp;rsquo;s under $100K, on a one-off job and there&amp;rsquo;s no regulations in play, then there&amp;rsquo;s no excuse for a bazillion pages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand contracts. I only sign one page contracts that are very simple.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not Thinking &amp;lt; Tactics &amp;lt; Strategy &amp;lt; Philosophy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Repeatedly stress that they&amp;rsquo;re making an investment into a durable and long-lasting asset. Costs get cut, assets get invested in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Use some multiplication and bullshit charts. Whoever is paying you needs to justify it. Make some charts and graphs about how an expensive logo correlates with making a lot of money or high share price.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The haggling doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if we&amp;rsquo;ll never see each other again. But if we&amp;rsquo;re going to interact more? Then haggling is a no-go: it destroys goodwill, since it makes things transactional.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do everything you can to &lt;mark&gt;stay relational/social instead of market/transactional&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be a trusted advisor. Over deliver on work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Transactional relationships are about paying as little as you can for as much as you can get. Social relationships are about giving as much as you can and far exceeding what you get.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need to make people feel pain when they don&amp;rsquo;t pay you on time, or otherwise break their word.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Write things down. Take them out and show them. People are funny about remembering what&amp;rsquo;s most convenient for them. Paper doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lay down a set of principles about what your time, your art, and your life are worth, and to explain them in advance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.) Regularly update with the work you completed, and the benefit it provides. 2.) Decide what you want, and what you&amp;rsquo;ll do as Plan B if your current company won&amp;rsquo;t give it to you. 3.) Go stress that you&amp;rsquo;d be able to produce more value if you transition your role to a more highly paid and enjoyable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t ask for money periodically, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to be underpaid&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to give whoever is paying you &amp;ldquo;the warm fuzzy feeling.&amp;rdquo; Part of that is letting them know what you&amp;rsquo;re working on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re doing work your boss doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand, how does he know how well you&amp;rsquo;re producing? Answer: He doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Unless you tell him. The person who describes what they&amp;rsquo;re doing and why it matters regularly will seem much, much more productive than the person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every savvy businessperson loves revenues and hates costs. If you&amp;rsquo;re a cost, they want to reduce your work. If you&amp;rsquo;re bringing in revenues, they want to expand your work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t just stress benefits to the company, also show how you&amp;rsquo;re making the people you work with look good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You really want to be a profit center rather than a cost center. Profit centers get expanded. Cost centers get cut.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need to know what you&amp;rsquo;re going to do if this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. BATNA, a backup plan, removes desperation. It also gives you a benchmark for how good an offer is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re always responsible for finance in any business you own, always, no matter what.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;mark&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;lsquo;what have you done for me lately&amp;rsquo; kind of world. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;what are you going to do for me going forwards&amp;rsquo; kind of world&lt;/mark&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t expect loyalty or pay or compensation for things you did in the past. You get loyalty and pay and compensation for things you&amp;rsquo;re going to do going forwards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t mention what you&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past. People hate that. It makes people feel guilty and makes you sound entitled.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://mariosanchez.org/img/rework.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/books/rework&#34;&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt; by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson is one of the best business books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. The authors take every single piece of business conventional wisdom and shatters them to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the books back cover says: ASAP is poison, underdo the competition, meetings are toxic, fire the workaholics, pick a fight, planning is guessing. All counterintuitive advice, but the authors will show you with facts that following their advise can lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some critics say that this book applies only to small businesses and start-ups, but I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in large companies almost all my life, and I find it&amp;rsquo;s tennets applicable no matter the size of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-highlights-and-notes&#34;&gt;My Highlights and Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The real world isn&amp;rsquo;t a place, it&amp;rsquo;s an excuse. It&amp;rsquo;s a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Failure is not a prerequisite for success. Evolution doesn&amp;rsquo;t linger on past failures, it&amp;rsquo;s always building upon what worked. So should you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can&amp;rsquo;t actually control.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Working without a plan may seem scary. But blindly following a plan that has no relationship with reality is even scarier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with finding the right size and staying there? Small is not just a stepping-stone. Small is a great destination. Anyone who runs a business that&amp;rsquo;s sustainable and profitable, whether it&amp;rsquo;s big or small, should be proud.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[Workaholics] try to make up for intellectual laziness with brute force.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If all you do is work, you&amp;rsquo;re unlikely to have sound judgments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your efforts need to feel valuable. You want your customers to say, &amp;ldquo;This makes my life better.&amp;rdquo; You want to feel that if you stopped doing what you do, people would notice. You should feel an urgency about this too. You don&amp;rsquo;t have forever. This is your life&amp;rsquo;s work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re going to do something, do something that matters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something you want to use.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Best of all, this &amp;ldquo;solve your own problem&amp;rdquo; approach lets you fall in love with what you&amp;rsquo;re making.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you&amp;rsquo;re new at something, you need to start creating. The most important thing is to begin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you want something bad enough, you make the time regardless of your other obligations. The truth is most people just don&amp;rsquo;t want it bad enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The perfect time never arrives. You&amp;rsquo;re always too young or old or busy or broke or something else. If you constantly fret about timing things perfectly, they&amp;rsquo;ll never happen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Keep in mind why you&amp;rsquo;re doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. Great businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a world of difference between truly standing for something and having a mission statement that says you stand for something. Standing for something isn&amp;rsquo;t just about writing it down. It&amp;rsquo;s about believing it and living it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No matter what kind of business you&amp;rsquo;re starting, take on as little outside cash as you can.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maybe eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll need to go the bigger, more expensive route, but not right now. Great companies start in garages all the time. Yours can too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The truth is every business, new or old, is governed by the same set of market forces and economic rules. Revenue in, expenses out. Turn a profit or wind up gone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A business without a path to profit isn&amp;rsquo;t a business, it&amp;rsquo;s a hobby.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy. You should be thinking about how to make your project grow and succeed, not how you&amp;rsquo;re going to jump ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace the idea of having less mass. Right now, you&amp;rsquo;re the smallest, the leanest, and the fastest you&amp;rsquo;ll ever be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time/money/people/experience.&amp;rdquo; Stop whining. Less is a good thing. Constraints are advantages in disguise. Limited resources force you to make do with what you&amp;rsquo;ve got. There&amp;rsquo;s no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re better off with a kick-ass half than a half-assed whole. Lots of things get better as they get shorter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Getting to great starts by cutting out stuff that&amp;rsquo;s merely good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So figure out your epicenter. Which part of your equation can&amp;rsquo;t be removed? If you can continue to get by without this thing or that thing, then those things aren&amp;rsquo;t the epicenter. When you find it, you&amp;rsquo;ll know. Then focus all your energy on making it the best it can be. Everything else you do depends on that foundation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ignore the details for a while. Nail the basics first and worry about the specifics later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;henever you can, swap &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s think about it&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s decide on it.&amp;rdquo; Commit to making decisions. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Decisions are progress. Each one you make is a brick in your foundation. You can&amp;rsquo;t build on top of &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll decide later,&amp;rdquo; but you can build on top of &amp;ldquo;Done.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Long projects zap morale. The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the stuff you leave out that matters. So constantly look for things to remove, simplify, and streamline. Be a curator. Stick to what&amp;rsquo;s truly essential. Pare things down until you&amp;rsquo;re left with only the most important stuff. Then do it again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When things aren&amp;rsquo;t working, the natural inclination is to throw more at the problem. More people, time, and money. All that ends up doing is making the problem bigger. The right way to go is the opposite direction: Cut back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you start pushing back deadlines and increasing your budget, you&amp;rsquo;ll never stop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The core of your business should be built around things that won&amp;rsquo;t change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now. Those are the things you should invest in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You just don&amp;rsquo;t need the best gear in the world to be good. And you definitely don&amp;rsquo;t need it to get started. In business, too many people obsess over tools, software tricks, scaling issues, fancy office space, lavish furniture, and other frivolities instead of what really matters. And what really matters is how to actually get customers and make money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you make something, you always make something else. You can&amp;rsquo;t make just one thing. Everything has a by-product. Observant and creative business minds spot these by-products and see opportunities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Think about it this way: If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut out? Funny how a question like that forces you to focus. You suddenly realize there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t need. And what you do need seems obvious. Build the necessities now, worry about the luxuries later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do everything you can to remove layers of abstraction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sometimes abandoning what you&amp;rsquo;re working on is the right move, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve already put in a lot of effort. Don&amp;rsquo;t throw good time after bad work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Interruption is not collaboration, it&amp;rsquo;s just interruption. And when you&amp;rsquo;re interrupted, you&amp;rsquo;re not getting work done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Problems can usually be solved with simple, mundane solutions. That means there&amp;rsquo;s no glamorous work. You don&amp;rsquo;t get to show off your amazing skills. You just build something that gets the job done and then move on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No one likes to be stuck on an endless project with no finish line in sight. To keep your momentum and motivation up, get in the habit of accomplishing small victories along the way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you&amp;rsquo;re going to finish it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Try to dedicate one day a week (or every two weeks) to small victories that generate enthusiasm. Small victories let you celebrate and release good news. And you want a steady stream of good news.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you already spent too much time on something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it, walk away. You can&amp;rsquo;t get that time back. The worst thing you can do now is waste even more time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What distinguishes people who are ten times more effective than the norm is not that they work ten times as hard; it&amp;rsquo;s that they use their creativity to come up with solutions that require one-tenth of the effort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Reality never sticks to best-case scenarios. Note: Hope for the best. Plan for the worst.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Estimates that stretch weeks, months, and years into the future are fantasies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The solution: Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You&amp;rsquo;re probably still going to get it wrong, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Long lists are guilt trips. The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you feel about it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have to understand why something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you miss that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How do you know if you&amp;rsquo;re copying someone? If someone else is doing the bulk of the work, you&amp;rsquo;re copying. Be influenced, but don&amp;rsquo;t steal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pour yourself into your product and everything around your product too: how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it. Competitors can never copy the you in your product.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you think a competitor sucks, say so. When you do that, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side. Being the anti-______ is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition. Instead of one-upping, try one-downing. Instead of outdoing, try underdoing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t shy away from the fact that your product or service does less. Highlight it. Be proud of it. Sell it as aggressively as competitors sell their extensive feature lists.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to build &amp;ldquo;the iPod killer&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the next Pokemon,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re already dead. You&amp;rsquo;re allowing the competition to set the parameters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start getting into the habit of saying no, even to many of your best ideas. Use the power of no to get your priorities straight. You rarely regret saying no. But you often wind up regretting saying yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Making a few vocal customers happy isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it if it ruins the product for everyone else.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be a jerk about saying no, though. Just be honest. If you&amp;rsquo;re not willing to yield to a customer request, be polite and explain why. People are surprisingly understanding when you take the time to explain your point of view.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your goal is to make sure your product stays right for you. You&amp;rsquo;re the one who has to believe in it most. That way, you can say, &amp;ldquo;I think you&amp;rsquo;ll love it because I love it.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Scaring away new customers is worse than losing old customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Companies need to be true to a type of customer more than a specific individual customer with changing needs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have as many great ideas as you can. Get excited about them. Just don&amp;rsquo;t act in the heat of the moment. Write them down and park them for a few days. Then, evaluate their actual priority with a calm mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once you do get bigger and more popular, you&amp;rsquo;re inevitably going to take fewer risks. When you&amp;rsquo;re a success, the pressure to maintain predictability and consistency builds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach them. Teaching probably isn&amp;rsquo;t something your competitors are even thinking about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Buying people&amp;rsquo;s attention with a magazine or online banner ad is one thing. Earning their loyalty by teaching them forms a whole different connection.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;People are curious about how things are made. It&amp;rsquo;s why they like factory tours or behind-the-scenes footage on DVDs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Imperfections are real and people respond to real. It&amp;rsquo;s why we like real flowers that wilt, not perfect plastic ones that never change. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about how you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to sound and how you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to act. Show the world what you&amp;rsquo;re really like, warts and all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Call someone. Write a personal note. If you read a story about a similar company or product, contact the journalist who wrote it. Pitch her with some passion, some interest, some life. Do something meaningful. Be remarkable. Stand out. Be unforgettable. That&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;ll get the best coverage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Accounting is a department. Marketing isn&amp;rsquo;t. Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marketing isn&amp;rsquo;t just a few individual events. It&amp;rsquo;s the sum total of everything you do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never hire anyone to do a job until you&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do it yourself first. That way, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand the nature of the work. You&amp;rsquo;ll know what a job well done looks like. You&amp;rsquo;ll know how to write a realistic job description and which questions to ask in an interview.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t hire for pleasure; hire to kill pain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The right time to hire is when there&amp;rsquo;s more work than you can handle for a sustained period of time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You want a specific candidate who cares specifically about your company, your products, your customers, and your job.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So how do you find these candidates? First step: Check the cover letter. In a cover letter, you get actual communication instead of a list of skills, verbs, and years of irrelevance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. They don&amp;rsquo;t need heavy direction. They don&amp;rsquo;t need daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do: set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc., but they do it by themselves and for themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Writing is today&amp;rsquo;s currency for good ideas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When something goes wrong, someone is going to tell the story. You&amp;rsquo;ll be better off if it&amp;rsquo;s you. Own the story.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s never really a great way to say you&amp;rsquo;re sorry, but there are plenty of terrible ways. One of the worst ways is the non-apology apology, which sounds like an apology but doesn&amp;rsquo;t really accept any blame.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Keep in mind that you can&amp;rsquo;t apologize your way out of being an ass. Even the best apology won&amp;rsquo;t rescue you if you haven&amp;rsquo;t earned people&amp;rsquo;s trust.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t create a culture. It happens. This is why new companies don&amp;rsquo;t have a culture. Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cut the crap and you&amp;rsquo;ll find that people are waiting to do great work. They just need to be given the chance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rockstar environments develop out of trust, autonomy, and responsibility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When everything constantly needs approval, you create a culture of nonthinkers. You create a boss-versus-worker relationship that screams, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t trust you.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Policies are organizational scar tissue. They are codified overreactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again. They are collective punishment for the misdeeds of an individual. This is how bureaucracies are born.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who said writing needs to be formal? Who said you have to strip away your personality when putting words on paper? Forget rules. Communicate!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you&amp;rsquo;re writing, don&amp;rsquo;t think about all the people who may read your words. Think of one person. Then write for that one person.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;ASAP is inflationary. It devalues any request that doesn&amp;rsquo;t say ASAP. Before you know it, the only way to get anything done is by putting the ASAP sticker on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Reserve your use of emergency language for true emergencies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We all have ideas. Ideas are immortal. They last forever. What doesn&amp;rsquo;t last forever is inspiration. Inspiration is like fresh fruit or milk: It has an expiration date. If you want to do something, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to do it now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
