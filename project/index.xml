Project Summary:
Mobile-friendly FX watcher.
Source Files | Demo
We will create a mobile web app that will display the current exchange of a basket of currencies versus the US dollar. Besides the current rate we also want to display the YTD % devaluation (or revaluation) for each of the currencies.
I decided to implement this project because I work in international marketing, and devaluation is always an important variable to follow when analyzing business results.</description>

A pleasantly styled image gallery that renders dynamically when the web page is called.
