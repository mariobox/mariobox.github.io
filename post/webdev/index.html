<p>I consider myself a self-taught <strong>junior web developer</strong>.</p>
<p>I picked up web development as a <strong>serious hobby</strong> about five years ago, but I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by th world wide web since the mid 1990&rsquo;s. Back then, being able to share your thoughts with the world instantly and at virtually no cost was (and <em>still</em> is) mind-boggling to me. That was the promise of the Internet and the WWW in their early days.</p>
<p>Since those early days, I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn everything about the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/">technologies</a> that make the web work.</p>
<p>I first started making websites with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage">Microsoft Frontpage</a> and hosting them in <a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/geocities-archive-netscape-browser-first-web-suburbs-aol/580285/">Geocities</a>. Both Frontpage and Geocities endured their share of criticism and ridicule as the web evolved, but I still remember those years fondly, and apparently <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">I am not alone</a>.</p>
<p>Then I moved up to registering my own domains and uploading my sites to shared hosting services via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. Then, when <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-web-20/">Web 2.0</a> came along, I learned to deploy <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> blogs and got into <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.</p>
<p>Not much later, large platforms that came to be known as <em>social networks</em> entered the playing field and started to aggregate Internet traffic at a furious pace. I spent a couple of years getting acquainted with them, only to become disillusioned as they morphed into sophisticated <a href="https://nomasters.io/posts/nonparticipation/">surveillance engines</a> built to spy and profit from their users.</p>
<p>The <strong>open</strong> and <strong>decentralized</strong> web that I had grown to love had started to die.</p>
<p>Then, at around 2012, I heard a few prominent hackers <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">talk</a> about something called <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/">static site generators</a>, and how they made them rediscover the excitement of publishing a personal website and experimenting with the code. I decided to go back to basics and re-learn the fundamentals of <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>. Soon, I was designing web pages from scratch with just a text editor, a blank page and my bare hands.</p>
<p>I was hooked.</p>
<p>I experimented with several static site generators, especially <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://metalsmith.io">Metalsmith</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> (my current setup).</p>
<p>I then decided to approach coding and web development in a more structured way, beyond just building static site. I enrolled in <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, the online coding school, and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion">completed</a> their <em>Front End Web Development</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> tracks. I also took courses on a variety of subjects, like <em>React</em> and <em>Node</em>. I deeply enjoyed Treehouse&rsquo;s teaching style.</p>
<p>I then took <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a>, the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, offered by <a href="https://edx.org">edX</a>, where I learned about algorithms, <em>C</em>, <em>JavaScript</em> and back-end development with <em>Python</em>, <em>Flask</em> and <em>SQL</em>. In parallel, I also learned <em>Git</em> and deployed a few virtual private servers. That is pretty much where I am today.</p>
<p>As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">introvert</a> with a bias for logic and rational thinking, coding is an activity that matches my personality better than anything else I&rsquo;ve tried-I just wish I had discovered it <em>earlier</em>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just starting and think coding is something you may enjoy, I would suggest starting with <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a> where you will learn the basics right. After that, you can keep learning specific languages, libraries and frameworks in sites like <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://codecademy.com">CodeCademy</a> or <a href="https://teamtreehouse">Treehouse</a>. There are also very good videos and tutorials in Youtube. Just Google the topic you&rsquo;re interested in and give some of those a try.</p>
