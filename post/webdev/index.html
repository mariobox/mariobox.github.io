  <p class="description">A path to learning web development and programming from my own experience</p>
  <div>
    <article id="content">
    <p>I consider myself a self-taught <strong>junior web developer</strong>.</p>

<p>I picked up web development as a <strong>serious hobby</strong> about five years ago, but my interest in and enthusiasm for the web go way back to the late 1990&rsquo;s. Back then, being able to share your thoughts with the world instantly and at virtually no cost was (and <em>still</em> is) mind-boggling to me. That was the promise of the Internet and the WWW in their early days.</p>

<p>Ever since, I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with understanding the technologies that make such a feat possible.</p>

<p>I first started making websites with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage">Microsoft Frontpage</a> and hosting them in <a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/geocities-archive-netscape-browser-first-web-suburbs-aol/580285/">Geocities</a>. Then I moved up to registering my own domains and uploading my sites to shared hosting services via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. Then, at the onset of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-web-20/">Web 2.0</a>, my focus switched to deploying <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> blogs and learning about <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Not much later, large platforms that came to be known as <em>social networks</em> entered the playing field and started to aggregate Internet traffic at a furious pace. I spent a couple of years getting acquainted with them, but became disillusioned when they morphed into sophisticated <a href="https://nomasters.io/posts/nonparticipation/">surveillance engines</a> built to spy and profit from their users.</p>

<p>The <strong>open</strong> and <strong>decentralized</strong> web that I had grown to love had started to die.</p>

<p>Then, at around 2012, I heard a few prominent hackers <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">talk</a> about something called <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/">static site generators</a>, and how they made them rediscover the excitement of publishing a personal website and experimenting with the code. I decided to go back to basics and re-learn the fundamentals of <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>. Soon, I was designing web pages from scratch with just a text editor, a blank page and my bare hands.</p>

<p>I was hooked.</p>

<p>After that, I delved deeply into understanding how static site generators worked, and experimented with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://metalsmith.io">Metalsmith</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> (my current setup).</p>

<p>I then decided to approach coding and web development in a more structured way, so when I heard about <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, the online coding school, I decided to enroll. It was a great experience. I <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion">completed</a> the <em>Front End Web Development</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> tracks and took courses on a variety of subjects, like <em>React</em> and <em>Node</em>.</p>

<p>I then took <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a>, the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, offered by <a href="https://edx.org">edX</a>, where I learned about algorithms, <em>C</em>, <em>JavaScript</em> and back-end development with <em>Python</em>, <em>Flask</em> and <em>SQL</em>. In parallel, I also learned <em>Git</em> and deployed a few virtual private servers.</p>

<p>As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">introvert</a> with a bias for logic and rational thinking, coding is an activity that matches my personality better than anything else I&rsquo;ve tried-I just wish I had discovered it <em>earlier</em>. I can sit down and code for hours without ever getting bored. For me, it almost feels like meditation in the sense that when I&rsquo;m coding I&rsquo;m engaged 100% and time doesn&rsquo;t seem to pass.</p>

<p>This notwithstanding, I&rsquo;ve gone through some periods of discouragement, during which I have stopped coding for a few weeks or months, consumed by doubts about ever becoming good enough to turn coding into a paying job.</p>

<p>But then I read an <a href="https://sivers.org/balance">article</a> by Derek Sivers, the gist of which is this: <em>do something for money, and do your art for its own sake. Don&rsquo;t burden your art with the need to make money from it</em>. From that day, I&rsquo;ve thrown myself back into coding and I&rsquo;ve learned something new every day.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re just starting and don&rsquo;t know if coding is for you, take a look at some of the <a href="/project/">projects</a> and <a href="/post/">posts</a> on this site, or drop me an email if you have any questions. I may be able to point you in the right direction or let you know what has worked for me.</p>
