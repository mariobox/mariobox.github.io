<p>I consider myself a self-taught <strong>junior web developer</strong>.</p>
<p>I picked up web development as a <strong>serious hobby</strong> about five years ago, but I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the world wide web since the mid 1990&rsquo;s. Back then, being able to share your thoughts with the world instantly and at virtually no cost was (and <em>still</em> is) mind-boggling to me.</p>
<p>The classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckc6XSSh52w">sound of a dial-up modem</a>, and the black and white text-based screen that followed it, had magic qualities that I still vividly remember up to this day.</p>
<p>Since those early days, I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn everything about the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/">technologies</a> that make the web work.</p>
<p>I first started making websites with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage">Microsoft Frontpage</a> and hosting them in <a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/geocities-archive-netscape-browser-first-web-suburbs-aol/580285/">Geocities</a>. If you were alive and active on the web back in those days you probably know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Both Frontpage and Geocities endured their share of criticism and ridicule as the web evolved, but to many of us those were the best days of the web. Apparently, <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">I&rsquo;m not the only one who feels that way</a>.</p>
<p>Later I became familiar with the process of registering my own domains and uploading basic websites to shared hosting services via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. As the web evolved and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-web-20/">Web 2.0</a> came along, I learned to deploy <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> blogs and the intricacies of <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.</p>
<p>Not much later, large platforms that came to be known as <em>social networks</em> entered the playing field and started to aggregate Internet traffic at a furious pace. I spent a couple of years getting acquainted with them, only to become disillusioned as they morphed into sophisticated <a href="https://nomasters.io/posts/nonparticipation/">surveillance engines</a> built to spy and profit from their users.</p>
<p>The <strong>open</strong>, <strong>decentralized</strong> and <strong>non-commercial</strong> web that I had grown to love had <a href="https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html">started to die</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even as most people moved to social media and lost interest in hosting their own personal site, I continued learning and found a new way of creating personal static sites: <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/">static site generators</a>.  SSG are programs that comb through one or more folders containing content files usually written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, convert them to HTML, and place them in a special folder that you can then deploy to the open web using any web hosting service.</p>
<p>Soon, with the help of static site generators and some basic HTML and CSS, I was designing web pages from scratch with just a text editor, a blank page and my bare hands.</p>
<p>It was at that point that I decided to approach web programming in a more structured way, beyond just building a static site. I enrolled in <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, the online coding school, and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion">completed</a> their <em>Front End Web Development</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> tracks. I also took courses on a variety of subjects, like <em>React</em>, <em>Node</em> and <em>Python</em>. I deeply enjoyed Treehouse&rsquo;s teaching style.</p>
<p>I then took <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a>, the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, offered by <a href="https://edx.org">edX</a>, where I learned about algorithms, <em>C</em>, <em>JavaScript</em> and back-end development with <em>Python</em>, <em>Flask</em> and <em>SQL</em>. In parallel, I also learned <em>Git</em> and deployed a few virtual private servers.</p>
<p>As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">introvert</a> with a bias for logic and rational thinking, programming and working with computers are two activities that match my personality better than anything else I&rsquo;ve tried-I just wish I had discovered it earlier.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just starting and think web programming is something you may enjoy, I would suggest starting with <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a>, where you will learn the basics right. After that, you can keep learning specific languages, libraries and frameworks in sites like <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://codecademy.com">CodeCademy</a> or <a href="https://teamtreehouse">Treehouse</a>.</p>
<p>Another online resource that I&rsquo;ve found very helpful, especially to understand hardware, software, operating systems, networking and how the Internet works are the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support">IT Support Certification</a> courses by Google that you can find at Coursera.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
