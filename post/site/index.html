<h2 id="goals-and-intentions">Goals and Intentions</h2>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>The main aim of this site is to serve as a <strong>web development playground</strong> where I can <strong>practice and document</strong> what I learn. This site also advocates for open-source web development and supports the open-source community.</p>

<h3 id="intentions">Intentions</h3>

<p>There are many ways to achieve a project&rsquo;s goals. I believe that the best one should reflect the <strong>values of the creator</strong>. Every project needs to start with a <strong>declaration of intentions or guiding principles</strong>. The guiding principles for this site are:</p>

<h4 id="1-minimalism">1. Minimalism:</h4>

<p>Everything we put on the site must support our goals. We will often remove what is no longer relevant (<em>less is more</em>). Both the <strong>code</strong> and the <strong>content</strong> will follow the <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a></abbr> principle.</p>

<h4 id="2-form-follows-function">2. Form Follows Function:</h4>

<p>We will favor a design that emphasizes <strong>content</strong>. Images should not be just decoration but must add value to the message. We will use mostly text, ample white space, bullets, bold and highlighted text for <strong>readability</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="3-privacy">3. Privacy:</h4>

<p>Visitors&rsquo; <strong>right to privacy</strong> is a primary concern. Visitors will be able to come and go as they please without being tracked. The site will be <strong>non-transactional</strong>, <strong>non-commercial</strong>, and will have <strong>no ulterior motive</strong> beyond documenting the author&rsquo;s web development journey and support the open-source community.</p>

<h4 id="4-open-source">4. Open Source:</h4>

<p>The site must be developed with <strong>open-source</strong> tools and technologies. It must honor the <strong>original intent</strong> of the creators of the <abbr title="Worldwide Web">WWW</abbr>: to bring people and ideas together through a free, decentralized and open system.</p>

<h4 id="5-life-long-learning">5. Life-Long Learning:</h4>

<p>We are a <strong>work in progress</strong>. Websites are no different: they are always <strong>under construction</strong>. As I learn new skills I will use them to make this site better.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<h3 id="static-vs-dynamic">Static vs. Dynamic:</h3>

<p>I decided to make the site <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/staticwebsite">static</a> instead of using a database-driven tool like Wordpress. This is the simplest, fastest and most secure set up. Static sites are <strong>ideal for blogs and small-to-medium sites</strong> where content doesn&rsquo;t change based on user input.</p>

<p>To create the site I use a <strong>static site generator</strong>, which is a program that combs through one or more folders containing content files usually written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, converts them to HTML, and places them in a special folder that you can then deploy to the open web using any web hosting service.</p>

<p>Static site generators can be written in any programming language. The most popular ones are <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Go</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="platform">Platform:</h3>

<p>I decided to use <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, a static site generator written in <strong>Go</strong> that prides itself of being the <strong>world&rsquo;s fastest framework</strong> for building websites. <strong>Hugo</strong> enjoys active community support, so the likelihood of having to deal with stale dependencies in the future is very small. Of all the platforms I&rsquo;ve used so far, <strong>Hugo</strong> has been the fastest and most reliable.</p>

<h3 id="look-and-feel">Look and Feel:</h3>

<p>I chose not to use third-party themes because most of them are bloated with useless features-which would run against my <strong>minimalist approach</strong>, and because I believe that a website should reflect the  style of the person creating it. That&rsquo;s why I use a hand-coded <a href="/css/minimal.css">CSS style sheet</a> optimized for speed, that provides a look and feel similar to a text editor from the early days of computing.</p>

<h3 id="no-analytics">No Analytics:</h3>

<p>Since my aim is to respect visitors&rsquo; privacy and remain non-commercial, this site <strong>doesn&rsquo;t run Google Analytics</strong> or any other tracking software. There are also <strong>no affiliate links</strong>. Links to the books I review point to the author&rsquo;s page or to <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/">Indiebound</a>, not to Amazon. This site is continuously monitored by the <abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr> <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a> browser extension to verify no tracking tools are present.</p>

<p><img src="/img/privacy.jpg" class="gallery large" /></p>

<h3 id="secure-https">Secure HTTPS:</h3>

<p>The site is served over <a href="/post/https/">HTTPS</a> (secure HTML) to ensure all traffic is <strong>encrypted</strong>. You may notice the <strong>lock</strong> icon next to the URL in the address bar:</p>

<p><img src="/img/httpsms.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3>

<p>The site is hosted in <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>: it&rsquo;s easy, reliable and free, and <strong>comes with HTTPS and custom domain support</strong>. Github Pages is a great solution for static sites and personal webites. As you may know, Microsoft acquired Github in 2018. While I try to stay away from Big Tech solutions, I am making this exception because Microsoft is showing support for the open-source community. If this changes I will move my site to a <strong>virtual private server</strong> at <a href="https://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>, as I&rsquo;ve done in the <a href="/post/vps">past</a>.</p>

<h2 id="my-hugo-site-setup-process">My Hugo Site Setup Process</h2>

<p>After installing <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>Hugo</strong> I created the skeleton for a new site by going to my command line and typing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hugo new site mysite</code></pre></div>
<p>This command creates a folder in your computer called <code>mysite</code> and populates it with several other folders, the most important of which are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>content</code> which holds your <strong>content files</strong></li>
<li><code>layouts</code> which holds your different <strong>page templates</strong>, and</li>
<li><code>static</code> which holds <strong>static assets</strong> such as images, style sheets and JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the <code>content</code> folder, I created two subfolders for the two types of content I wanted to display on my site:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>post</code>: Things I write (blog posts, book reviews, etc.)</li>
<li><code>project</code>: A portfolio of my coding projects</li>
</ul>

<p>All content files are written in <strong>Markdown</strong>.</p>

<p>To control the layout I created three <code>_default</code> templates inside the <code>layouts</code> folder:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>single.html</code> to display single pages (same template for blog posts, projects and notes)</li>
<li><code>list.html</code> to display any collection of posts, projects, notes, etc. I chose to display just titles and dates.</li>
<li><code>li.html</code> to display the title and date of each individual post or project.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also in the <code>layouts</code> folder I created an <code>index.html</code> file, which contains the code for the home page of the site.</p>

<p>Finally, I created two <code>partials</code> templates: <code>header.html</code> and <code>footer.html</code> that can be called from the other templates. These two templates contain information common to all pages of the site.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s basically it.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m adding content to the site, I run <code>hugo server</code> to open a development server in <code>localhost:1313</code> where I can see all my changes in real time. Once I&rsquo;m finished editing I simply run the command <code>hugo</code>, and  the static files are created and placed in a <code>public</code> folder that I can then deploy to <strong>Github Pages</strong> using <a href="/post/gcs">Git</a>.</p>

<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>

<p>As of May 10, 2020, I am documenting all significant changes to this site in a <a href="/post/changelog/">changelog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="closing-comments">Closing Comments</h2>
