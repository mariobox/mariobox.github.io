  <h1>My Web Development Journey</h1>
  <p class="description">A path to learning web development and programming from my own experience</p>  
    <article id="content">
    <p>I am a self-taught amateur web developer. I picked up web development as a serious hobby about five years ago, but I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the World Wide Web since the mid 1990&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Back then, this newfound ability to share your thoughts with the world instantly (and at virtually no cost) blew my mind. If you were around back then you may probably remember the excitement of hearing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckc6XSSh52w">sound of a dial-up modem</a>, and accessing the black and green text-based screen that usually followed it.</p>
<p>Since those early days, I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn everything I can about the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/technology/2017/">technologies</a> that make the WWW work.</p>
<p>I first started making websites with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage">Microsoft Frontpage</a> and hosting them in <a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/geocities-archive-netscape-browser-first-web-suburbs-aol/580285/">Geocities</a>. Again, if you were around those days you probably know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Both Frontpage and Geocities endured their share of criticism and ridicule as the web evolved, but to many of us those were the <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">best days of the web</a>.</p>
<p>I later became familiar with the process of registering domains and uploading basic websites to shared hosting services via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. As the web evolved and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-web-20/">Web 2.0</a> came along, I learned to deploy <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> blogs and delved into the intricacies of <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.</p>
<p>Not much later, however, large platforms that came to be known as <em>social networks</em> entered the playing field aggregating Internet traffic at a furious pace. I spent a couple of years getting acquainted with some of them, only to become disillusioned as they morphed into sophisticated <a href="https://nomasters.io/posts/nonparticipation/">surveillance engines</a> built to spy and profit from their users. Some people even refer to those days as the <a href="https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html">death of the world wide web</a>.</p>
<p>After a small hiatus, I discovered <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/">static site generators</a> and got excited about the web again. Soon, with the help of static site generators and some basic HTML and CSS, I was designing web pages from scratch with just a text editor, the Linux command line and my bare hands.</p>
<p>It was at that point that I decided to approach web programming in a more structured way. I enrolled in <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, an online coding school, and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion">completed</a> their Front End Web Development and JavaScript tracks. I also took courses on a variety of subjects, like React, Node and Python. I deeply enjoyed Treehouse&rsquo;s teaching style.</p>
<p>From then on, it was off to the races: I took <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a>, the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, offered by <a href="https://edx.org">edX</a>, where I learned about algorithms, <em>C</em>, <em>JavaScript</em> and back-end development with <em>Python</em>, <em>Flask</em> and <em>SQL</em>. At around the same time, I also learned to deployed virtual private servers.</p>
<p>As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">introvert</a> with a bias for logic and rational thinking, programming and working with computers are two activities that match my personality better than anything else I&rsquo;ve tried-I just wish I had discovered it earlier.</p>
<p>If web programming sounds like something you may enjoy, I would suggest starting with <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a>, where you will learn the basics right. After that, you can keep learning specific languages, libraries and frameworks in sites like <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://codecademy.com">CodeCademy</a>, <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a> or <a href="https://teamtreehouse">Treehouse</a>. Also, I recommend taking a course on the Linux Command Line, since you will be using it all the time for web development.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
