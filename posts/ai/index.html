  <h1>Quick Thoughts on AI</h1>
  <p class="description">When answers are cheap, questions become valuable</p>  
  <hr />
    <article id="content">
    <p>A few weeks ago I asked <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> to write a 500-word article about the different types of batteries used in power tools. Since I&rsquo;m very familiar with the topic, I was curious to see how ChatGPT would do. In a matter of seconds, ChatGPT generated a surprisingly good article, accurate and very well written (and not one word longer than 500).</p>
<p>My first thought was: those poor chaps writing website copy and search engine fodder at Fiverr for 10 dollars a piece better find another line of work. However, the implications of this technology go beyond just low-level copywriters. Highly paid professionals, like computer programmers or doctors, are also in the path of this disruptive technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine a near future in which you can ask an AI to write a program in Python to tell you when to sell a certain stock, or to use an AI trained with the knowledge and experience of every doctor who ever lived to diagnose an illness based on a list of symptoms.</p>
<p>All this begs the question:</p>
<p><strong>if getting answers to common questions is becoming a commodity at near-zero cost, what will become valuable?</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the best answer I&rsquo;ve found comes from <strong>Kevin Kelly</strong> in his prophetic book <a href="https://kk.org/books/the-inevitable">The Inevitable</a>, written in 2016. <strong>KK</strong> says: <em>&ldquo;When answers are free or easy, what becomes valuable are good questions&rdquo;</em>. He goes on to define what a good question is:</p>
<p><strong>A good question&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is not concerned with a correct answer.</li>
<li>Cannot be answered immediately.</li>
<li>Challenges existing answers.</li>
<li>Is one you badly want answered once you hear it, but had no inkling you cared before it was asked.</li>
<li>Creates a new territory of thinking.</li>
<li>Reframes its own answers.</li>
<li>Is a seed for innovation in science, technology, art, politics and business.</li>
<li>Is a probe, a what-if scenario.</li>
<li>Skirts on the edges of what is known and not known, neither silly nor obvious.</li>
<li>Cannot be predicted.</li>
<li>Generates many other good questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <strong>KK</strong> concludes, asking good questions will be the sign of an educated mind. It will also be the last job a machine will learn how to do, and ultimately what humans are here for.</p>
