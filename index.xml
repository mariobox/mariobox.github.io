Here are the specs:
  Models: Your application should have at least three models in addition to the User model: one for auction listings, one for bids, and one for comments made on auction listings. It’s up to you to decide what fields each model should have, and what the types of those fields should be.</description>

      <description>Computer: I recently purchased an HP Pavilion x360 with a 14&amp;rdquo; display. It has an Intel Core i5-1035G1 Processor, 8GB SDRAM, and 256 SSD. This is a great laptop for the price. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the smaller screen since my intention is to maximize portability (while at home, I do most of my web development work in a large monitor anyway).
  Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Some of the most significant developments in the world of programming and web development are easily accessible from the Linux command line.</description>

      <description>The Psychology of Money, by Morgan Housel, is probably the first book I would read. More than short term tactics, it deals with the mindset we need to develop to acquire wealth.
I have included the most relevant quotes from the book below, although I highly recommend that you read the whole book.

      <description>I am a self-taught amateur web developer. I picked up web development as a serious hobby about five years ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by the World Wide Web since the mid 1990&amp;rsquo;s.
Back then, this newfound ability to share your thoughts with the world instantly (and at virtually no cost) blew my mind. If you were around back then you may probably remember the excitement of hearing the sound of a dial-up modem, and accessing the black and green text-based screen that usually followed it.</description>

Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status  Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. The purpose of wealth is freedom; it’s nothing more than that. Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits; it’s the ability to have credits and debits of other people’s time. Having wealth means not having to be any place you don’t want to be, or not having to do anything you don’t want to do.</description>

To find your terminal click on the Show Applications icon and type the word &amp;ldquo;terminal&amp;rdquo; in the search box. Then, click on the terminal icon, similar to the one below:
Tip: you may want to right-click on the terminal icon and choose &amp;ldquo;Add To Favorites&amp;rdquo;, to pin it to the task bar, since you&amp;rsquo;re going to be using it often.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, the company moved us to a new office. When we walked into our shiny, new cubicles we found a single sheet of paper laid out on top of our recently installed, empty desks describing something called The 6S Discipline.
It was a concise list of 6 bullet points that summarized a process to keep our work stations clean and organized. I later found out that the 6S concept comes from the Lean Manufacturing philosophy, the principles of which can also be applied to an office setting.</description>

      <description>Ego Is The Enemy, by Ryan Holiday, came highly recommended by Derek Sivers. It explores how remaining humble and embracing a learning mindset can lead to success. Here are my favorite highlights:
&amp;ldquo;If ego is the voice that tells us we’re better than we really are, we can say ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity.</description>

It works fine, with some improvements yet to be made, like limiting the display to a certain number of digits so that they fit in the calculator window when the number is too large.

Here are my most important takeaways:
Massive results take time Whether we are trying to build wealth, lose weight, learn a new language or any other worthwhile pursuit, success only comes after small, consistent actions performed over a long period of time.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I was rehearsing a presentation, and one of my co-workers recorded it on video. What an eye opener! I was terrible&amp;hellip;
After getting some honest feedback and a few tips, and going through the presentation for five or six more times, my delivery got better, to the point that I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t have to cringe when I watched it.
As if fate had it, a few days later I was at a Fedex store and saw Talk Like TED, by Carmine Gallo, sitting on the shelves.</description>

      <description>If you use a Linux-style terminal you may find yourself typing the same commands over and over again. If this is the case, you may wish to use some shorthand that the terminal can understand. You can do that with Aliases.
You start by going to your user directory and opening your .bashrc file. A .bashrc is a shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively. You can put any command in that file that you could type at the command prompt.</description>

A few weeks ago I came across the concept of SPA, or Single Page Application, and learned that they can be created with Angular.js, a JavaScript library supported by Google.
Most definitions of SPA you can find online are very technical and full of jargon, so perhaps the best way a newbie web developer like me can understand it is with an example:</description>

      <description>Finally managed to read A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine. The book came highly recommended by Derek Sivers, an artist and writer that I respect and identify with due to our almost identical world views.
I had only a vague idea of what stoicism was prior to reading the book, but based on my little knowledge I suspected that I have been practicing, albeit unknowingly, many of the tenets of this philosophy.</description>

      <description>I needed a quiet space at home where I could sit down and tweak the code of my site, and otherwise tinker with some web development tools I want to learn. Since my second bedroom had some empty space and a window with a nice view of the garden, it was the perfect place to try to fit a small workstation.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend a lot of money but I still wanted my new writing setup to look good, so my logical first stop was Ikea&amp;rsquo;s website.</description>

      <description>I decided to read Work The System when it was highly recommended by two respected business thinkers that I follow online: Josh Kaufman and Sebastian Marshall. Also, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been very busy lately and a deep understanding of systems, standardization and automation will bring more control, less stress, and more time for value-adding activities like thinking, strategizing, and staying healthy.
The book didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint, and left me with plenty of actionable steps.</description>

      <description>Sebastian Marshall put together this book in a week (mostly from blog content) as a dare to an old-school publisher who had offered to publish it but had been dragging the project for months. As a result, some passages may sound repetitive and there are several grammatical and spelling errors, but don&amp;rsquo;t get fooled: there is gold on those pages if you just can see beyond that.

      <description>A few years ago, during a trip to Bentonville, Arkansas, I had the chance to visit Walmart’s first store (originally called Walton’s 5-10), and picked up a leaflet containing Sam Walton’s 10 rules for building a successful business. Pearls of wisdom, straight from the man who built the world’s most successful retailer out of nothing. Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find a link to it on the Internet, I am transcribing them below (all of them are great, but I especially like #7, #9 and #10):</description>

      <description>Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson is one of the best business books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. The authors take every single piece of business conventional wisdom and shatters them to pieces.
As the books back cover says: ASAP is poison, underdo the competition, meetings are toxic, fire the workaholics, pick a fight, planning is guessing. All counterintuitive advice, but the authors will show you with facts that following their advise can lead to success.</description>
