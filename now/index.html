           <p>Since March 12, a few days before the Safe-At-Home order was issued for South Florida, I&rsquo;ve been mostly <abbr title="Working From Home">WFH</abbr> (I&rsquo;m lucky), riding my bike and making home-cooked meals. It&rsquo;s been an interesting, even enjoyable time, considering the terrible situation we&rsquo;re all facing every day.</p>

<p>On the coding front, I&rsquo;ve recently moved my site to a different platform: from <a href="https://metalsmith.io">Metalsmith</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. I&rsquo;m totally enjoying my new setup. Hugo is lightning fast, stable and user-friendly.</p>

<p>I also converted an old laptop into a <a href="/post/chromebook">Chromebook</a>. I even tried to revive an old <a href="/img/ipod.jpg">iPod Shuffle</a> that I found lying around, but the battery wasn&rsquo;t good any more.</p>

<p>I have also entertained <strong>a few thoughts</strong> around our &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; that perhaps will become topics for blog posts or discussions later on.</p>

<p>Here are a few of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><abbr title="Working From Home">WFH</abbr></strong>: Eliminating my 2-3 hour commute has been a game changer, allowing me to get more work done while optimizing for health and family. Will WFH become mainstream?</li>
<li><strong>Essential Workers</strong>: I&rsquo;ve gained a new appreciation for folks who perform thankless jobs like cleaning, delivering stuff, stocking shelves, caring for people, etc. In times like these we realize that we could very well do with less lawyers or hedge fund managers, but not without the <strong>essential workers</strong> that make day-to-day activities happen. These people are not paid enough. We need to pay them more.</li>
<li><strong>Education</strong>: While the online experiment hasn&rsquo;t gone too well at the elementary, middle and high school levels, college online education should become more prevalent. The cost of a traditional college education has become so outrageous that we are now questioning its worth. Will colleges be able to afford their real estate and bloated workforce in an era where students can do most of their learning online? My guess is that the top 10-15 universities will, while the rest will have to reinvent themselves or fold. Here are some <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/post-corona-higher-ed">interesting thoughts</a> on the subject from Prof. Galloway.</li>
<li><strong>The Environment</strong>: After only a few weeks of decreased activity, skies in the most polluted cities in the world are now clear, rivers are clean and transparent, and wildlife is reclaiming its space. Will we finally recognize that our actions <strong>DO</strong> impact the environment? Will most of us be willing to change our ways?</li>
<li><strong>Health Care</strong>: When 26 million people can become unemployed in a matter of days, does it make sense to keep tying health insurance to employment? Has the time finally come to consider universal health insurance?</li>
<li><strong>Retirement</strong>: Do we really think that 401Ks will provide for a good retirement? What about the 40% of people who don&rsquo;t have 401Ks? Can ordinary people afford to have their retirement funds tied to stocks when the stock market can drop 20%-30% in a matter of days? How resilient our companies really are, if they can&rsquo;t withstand even a few weeks without income?</li>
<li><strong>The Fed</strong>: The Fed has created trillions of dollars out of thin air to &ldquo;support the economy&rdquo;. While some money is going directly to people, most of it is going to prop up corporations with little or no strings attached. One may start to question why do we have to pay taxes, or why do we have to believe the argument that &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t afford&rdquo; health care for all, if the Fed can just create new money at will.</li>
<li><strong>Price Reset</strong>: Is asset deflation coming now that people will have less money to spend? What are the implications on the price of houses, stocks or big ticket items like cars? Will they become cheaper? Or, on the other hand, will the Fed&rsquo;s actions cause runaway inflation?</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Universal Basic Income">UBI</abbr></strong>: Most likely many of the jobs that were lost will never come back. Even before the crisis, <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate">labor force participation</a> was already a low 63%. Hasn&rsquo;t the time come to consider Unviersal Basic Income?</li>
<li><strong>Real Life Experiences</strong>: This might be a contrarian view now that everybody is betting on a massive move online for most business sectors, but once the pandemic starts to wane off, could we possibly see a consumer shift toward activities that emphasize human contact, like live classes, movies, travel, concerts, etc.? Will people get tired of being online?</li>
<li><strong>Experts</strong>: These days it is difficult to know who to trust. Everybody seems to have an agenda. If we leave it up to doctors, we would never leave our house. If we leave it up to business leaders, we would all get sick and maybe die. We need a middle ground: can we just slowly get back to normal, with basic precautions like wearing masks and staying a comfortable distance away from people? Can governments just issue recommendations and let people decide for themselves?</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Do It Yourself">DIY</abbr></strong>: Now that we&rsquo;ve spent months at home doing everything ourselves, will we keep our DIY streak alive in the future? Will we decide to build or fix more things at home, cook more often, do more things ourselves instead of hiring somebody? Will I ever go back to the barber shop now that I can give myself a pretty decent buzz cut?</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think? Any ideas?</p>
